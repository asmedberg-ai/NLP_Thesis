high,lost,demo,solutions engineer  but but thats what tends to happen with with typical bi applications because thats the only way they have to actually access that data so for example lets take a look at the revenue lets look at it on a monthly basis and lets look at this you know lets actually just look at a particular store removed store number  we want to look at lets just say joey donuts and maybe yeah lets break it down by age group  data drill down ends  client  hey solutions engineer as you as you just went through that how did you how did those dropdown selections come up is that because of prior history or is that are you looking at i dont know what what what created that selection list so if you go back on age group or yeah i dont know if that was one of them,"{'polarity': -0.034567901234567905, 'subjectivity': 0.29012345679012347, 'sentiment': 'Negative'}",-0.034567901,0.290123457,Negative,0

high,lost,customer base,client  but so i have a strategic plan that ive been working on theres sort of a aspiration all introduction thing but in in the middle of this theres theres reallyremoved    removed sort of of three components theres a strategic plan whereas your typical vision principals objectives and the road map in the roadmap is broken down by six major initiatives that ill call modernization and management types of initiatives and like i mentioned met a data and master data or a couple of things that ill probably be taking the lead on here account executive  hi cool client  then introducing data governance you know what does it mean to be an owner steward custodian what kind of committees you know governance you know councils or wherever we want to put it in place and how do we want to manage our assets is kinda going on but then theres the tactical reference architecture section let me jump down to that here  customer base ends  client  spend account executive  the nine months this is thorough client  so this is sort of the gives you a bit of a look at sort of where im hoping to take things account executive  okay client  and this sort of shows you where were at today sort of that current state future state thing that ive been working on,"{'polarity': -0.09851851851851852, 'subjectivity': 0.549351851851852, 'sentiment': 'Negative'}",-0.098518519,0.549351852,Negative,0
high,lost,about company,client  sure account executive  alright client  snameng account executive  okay sounds good let me know can you see my screen here yep okay sweet move some zoom stuff around one second alright so so were actually company were founded in removed we we just had a removed anniversary and as you probably saw in the ebook very much focused on search search types  removed    removed account executive  so our founders came from third party vendor when they founded the company a lot of the tools that you guys using today were already around like there was not a need for another dashboarding tool but the ability to search your data like you would you know hop on third party vendor and ask a question get an answer back that wasnt really available and so we brought search a search bar essentially to enterprise data we pair that with a i driven insights and this is basically as you make searches where you begin to learn whats most relevant to you and over time will elevate those keywords to the top and search ill show you what that looks like account executive  when we hop into a quick demo youll be interested in this because it sounds like youre pretty technical when we first started there was no data warehouse that had the performance to deliver a quality search experience so we actually started with our own in memory database and we call it falcon deployed it account executive  you basically bought as much hardware as a software and we had a very very high performance on premises appliance and works great but we basically were saying hey you you already did all this work in your data warehouse now you gotta move all that into into company just for bi  data architecture  account executive and what were doing today is you can see on the right is now are partnered with all the cloud data warehouses because now theyve got the performance to deliver a great search experience we essentially just live query the data thats in those cloud data warehouses and company is really just a search bar that sits on top now  data management  functions  account executive and so rather than than having to do that data modeling process twice youre doing it once and you can now i mean theres theres a lot of other tools in the space like a data robot for example or whatever else you might want to do on top of that data you dont have to worry about whether its in multiple places about company  removed    removed account executive  and so were just getting you were attacking it where it is normally i dont go in that order but the technology originally led us to a bunch of big customers because add hawk analytics is something that was a challenge for everybody and so the removed so the world and the apples of the world  pricing  account executive  were willing to spend a lot of money to solve this problem now were coming way down market as well and weve got customers that are starting at a much smaller price point because theyve adopted its like we connect to it in  minutes and theyre off searching and so you can really get going fast ,"{'polarity': 0.21750773260555867, 'subjectivity': 0.4472027260179435, 'sentiment': 'Positive'}",0.217507733,0.447202726,Positive,1

high,won,company product,clientsales engineer thing from the search perspective wanted to show you guys is part of that intelligence component of of company so lets say we have a simple search like this whats our weekly payment amounts and i can see there is this huge spike in march of this year and i want to figure out what changed between the week before that and then and of course we can search and drill down and ask a bunch of questions to figure that out there is also the auto analysis component of company work and say hey just look at this data slice and dice and all these different combinations and tell me what the most significant drivers that increase are and what that results in as something like this where payment amount went from removed between those two weeks and here are the biggest driver so removed of our removed cities have the biggest increase for see city accounted for removed of the change or here are claims that were the biggest increases or heres the specialty that drove the biggest increase so its not meant to be a full on data science tool replacing highly paid data scientists at your organization but its really meant to augment that non technical user and offer them some additional insights as theyre exploring the data and then with all of that its still live interactive company where someone says hey thats understand this but specialty drove the increase i wonder if it was a particular claim type or a particular practitioner or whatever the next question is you can always ask it and then also get a feedback so maybe you always know that the largest removed in city is always going to be the biggest driver of increases so you could say hey its actually is not insightful or hey something brand new popped up super interesting give it a thumbs up the point is the more feedback and get more to run the more insightful this type of thing becomes every timeremoved   removedclient yeah i i see that this is extremely valuable just because the every day and non technical user role would have to do these drill downs to figure out what change company product ends client so if we know there was an increase and denials they would have to build down and figure out exactly where that being curious wasnt the only way to do that is by doing the additional you know in in our case would be putting data in excel doing pivots im trying to figure out exactly whats driving it so i see this as i see this is a very cool feature that would helpclient yeah it could be a way to get people out of using excel although i know that theres some cool stuff coming with third party vendor and direct excel going to data sets and things like that with pivot tables but thats still pretty rudimentary compared to what youre seeing here industry issues client speaking of excel i was gonna ask question because as soon as you put this in front of a user theyre gonna ask the questions how do i how do i download the data behind it theyre gonna let us get that data out and no nameer how much we push and show them they can do it all here and there and are there limits so hes going to be the smaller question you know data transfer sales engineer yeah you can always download any of your charts as an excel file you can also view the underlying data if you want the actual transaction level details behind a certain data point and you could say hey i want to grab all these data download it as an excel file as well so multiple options there pinboard client yeah and im assuming you can share right that little share buttonsales engineerremoved   removed yeah exactly or or lead me to where exactly where i was going so you can either shared from that search experience do you want to share an individual chart i had been pinging these things along the way to this newly created dashboard and then from here i could follow it and say i want in my email on a regular basis on whatever schedule i choose or share it to your question and i could say hey i want to give access to my executives theyre going to be viewers or editors depending on who im giving access to what access level they have say this out ill hit share that group will get an email and say sales engineer to share it out this pin board with you and itll be a direct link back back here in the company and then they can begin exploring so jumping right in can begin exploring here without having to go straight to the full on search experience so you can just start to ask the questions from here and i could say i wanna look at the specialty do my drill down all within this pin board experience again were just not enough rebuilding this these past that they have to go downclient  so if we name this is a static view pinboard ends client so lets say i send it to somebody today and i look at it three days from now are they looking at this specific view as of june  second or is it refresh when they look at it and if it doesnt refresh that they have the ability to refresh,"{'polarity': 0.11537175324675322, 'subjectivity': 0.437850233100233, 'sentiment': 'Positive'}",0.115371753,0.437850233,Positive,1
high,won,company product,sales engineer its a live query to third party vendor the whole time so when they popping it up those will be query sent to third party vendor okayclientclient yeah im going back to the the cpu or the cost side of third party vendor i mean if you get a lot of users looking at different things all the time its going to add up so that thats definitely a consideration butclient yeah at the same time if theyre all sorry manclientremoved   removed and you kinda bounced that go ahead client lets say at the same time like if theyre all looking at this dashboard though that that the query that sending us the same and third party vendor has the cached data you know that where it will it will reuse cache data data architecture ends client so you know i it would be the exploration piece that would be is going to be added to it mostly not a bunch of people looking at the dashboard but yeahthat thatwe lose you runname i think i think we lostokayyeahokayclientaccount executiveclientclientclientaccount executiveyep client and actually everybody that is a great point on one of the things we also encourage is get it into a realistic number of users hands for the trial so you can also measure get at least a sample size of the third party vendor costsclientyou had mentioned some sales engineer just curious use,"{'polarity': -0.007593795093795089, 'subjectivity': 0.3402777777777778, 'sentiment': 'Negative'}",-0.007593795,0.340277778,Negative,0
high,won,about company,sales engineer the flip side and really the core of company though is search and thats where hey i have a brand new question its not in the dashboard i wanna just free form ask it like i would go on third party vendor or third party vendor to find something so lets start with a high level question,"{'polarity': 0.14939393939393938, 'subjectivity': 0.33242424242424246, 'sentiment': 'Positive'}",0.149393939,0.332424242,Positive,1
high,won,demo,sales engineer i wanna see how many removed we have by specialty and youll see as im typing here company making suggestions so as i type its its not just looking at the columns and names and my data but its actually every individual value and this is that search index that account executive mentioned behind the scenes data drill down sales engineer is as im typing company to making suggestions so i dont have to go looking for a specific field i know i have something very specific in mind that im looking for and im just gonna start typing lets say i wanna look at this on a monthly basis,"{'polarity': -0.007936507936507945, 'subjectivity': 0.3251984126984127, 'sentiment': 'Negative'}",-0.007936508,0.325198413,Negative,0
low,lost,small talk,client  yeah you you tell me what what you need me to do here project systems engineermarketing  me fair enough can take it to so i can get a copy as well lets go ahead and if you dont mind open then company i think we should be goodclient  yeah im on the pin board now do you want me to start with like a blank  pinboard ends  project systems engineermarketing  sorry im seeing on my friend double screens i see some chat client  okay client  there you go project systems engineermarketing  perfect do you mind if i take control i dont know if your company let me do that through zoom or not client  you can give it a shot project systems engineermarketing  okay so im gonna try and do a training room of the project systems engineermarketing  zoom and remove some of the bremoveder stuff see if i can  pinboard  project systems engineermarketing  perfect okay yeah let me try had some of these zoom and news and then this go to and this is looking good did you have any preference client one of the things that i like to do on the pin board is to use explore on one of the visuals and then maybe do a filter or something like that and then also to present one of them and share that drill down do you have a preference on any of these client  does it matter if were just trying to think what would be easiest wont be the easiest one would probably be the product one im guessing the one you were actually just on pinboard ends  project systems engineermarketing  okay yeah let me go to that quick man just trying to get this live on the fly and see how it goes project systems engineermarketing  filtered so this quarter maybe client  the the data is only through september project systems engineermarketing  okay maybe ill try the one next to that then client  all of the data is through september though so its just this quarters a bad filter is project systems engineermarketing  okay what about these options client  now it might be easier i dont know if we just want to type it in oops sorry somebody whos calling me on my thing  data drill down  project systems engineermarketing  what if we do a replace maybe see what options are exempt once a year with quarter view client  the quarter is probably not like an interesting one project systems engineermarketing  yeahclient  i dont know if or do you want to like stick with like the suggestions or or if we type something in eventually does that just become a suggestion if you type it enough times  data drill down ends  project systems engineermarketing  definitely i could type it in enough times should client  so like as a filter for instance you could put like if you typed in a cct lets see if we get yeah that account type group to even actually no sorry i dont do a contract to there should be like an account discount indicated the first one project systems engineermarketing  cool client  and you can just say equals y pops up project systems engineermarketing  why client  yeah lets see what that does client  yeah so this is like all of our business that has an project systems engineermarketing  okay okay lets try that again and see if it shows up now project systems engineermarketing  right project systems engineermarketing  what is the ph d by the wayclient  its homeowners okay its a horrible name but thats somebody  years ago made that project systems engineermarketing  yeah its the funnel data yes like product homeowners something client  yes project systems engineermarketing  okay its not giving us that project systems engineermarketing  hey this makes sense client  yeah i mean the adds not bad like for instance like the account type group too thats thats an okay one project systems engineermarketing  i think client  its not going to visualize it though because its im trying to think if you if you go back for a second to get out of this thing client  well what if you just do the basic one nicole down by month the second one i wonder if theres better options now the pre post doesnt really mean project systems engineermarketing  yeah probably i was gonna make tables that client  im im in my maybe not try like the account type group to now i wonder if it just makes because theres only three values wonderful make three lines yeah okayproject systems engineermarketing  yeah  something like that client project systems engineermarketing  cool ill get back to that that was under ad right client  yeah project systems engineermarketing  yep  small talk  client  throw myself im doing this survey project systems engineermarketing  okay cool thanks client  thats the last thing we need person message to project systems engineermarketing  you should see some of them that i get anytime i have to share my entire screen i always tell everyone sorry about my friends client  in where client  yeah project systems engineermarketing  especially now our our local brewery started doing a draft of the week yeah client project systems engineermarketing  so now thats probably what  percent of my text messages and client  yeah account executive  hey project systems engineermarketing hawaii so client  jeez you know i was liking you it for us now account executive  much regularly someones project systems engineermarketing  gotta do it account executive  logan breweries its its a little different coming from a line up there yeah shes coasters client  well you know project systems engineermarketing if you need me to make a trip out and doing this in person account executive  itd probably project systems engineermarketing  be easier client  yeah i thinkproject systems engineermarketing  so other than the  hour name but client  you know what a sacrifice project systems engineermarketing  my gosh we just had a a systems engineermarketing off site in city but we were flying back from we went to my brothers in missouri for thanksgiving and our lay over was an outlay and we booked that before we can books before the systems engineermarketing offsite got announced and so and now law i switched over to that took a rental car down to city and my wife flew back with the kids tool here  small talk ends  project

low,won,demo,clienthello okayup inaccount executivenamehere now its just so so because you have more than  customers or partners sorry you have more than number or with the partners and its trying to slice by number so i was saying so yeah again theres theres a way in the syntax to say top five partners by partner call partner item cost instead of top days we had the we had the wording a little wrong and so it render the wrong thing but theres a way to limit the customers down to a smaller set but yeah i think you get the idea of of kind of how you play with it and yeahaccount executivesales engineer hello client as as another one lets say like one of these spikes are valleys you wanted to drill in data drill down sales engineer im not sure what you want to drill into but all you gotta do is hover over it right click and hit drill down and youll get a list of all those attributes data drill down ends sales engineer so if you wanted to go into state city zip or what have you you could do that or any of them carrier or you can type in there and itll bring it up there you go partner name and if you dont right and you can also actually if you go into the far left access there you see where it has been a little carrot click on that okayclientsales engineer yup and you could sort this the sending or whatever annual annual you know you just just another way to look at the data right so now youve got likethe top everything right and you can even fit the number to the to the screen as well versus the scroll bar name sales engineer like you see there and down at the bottom theres a scroll bar because of number data pointsclientlong tail probably is not as useful right drops off significantly down herewhat elsethat i want to so we didsales engineeraccount executivesales engineerthe other thing is maybe you dont want a pretty picture you see where youve got a little button up here thats got the blue yeah click on the table view or click on that button data drill down sales engineer and this is sticky so if you just want to operate in a tabular view you can do that as well okayclientsales engineer the auto visualization is the other way and if you just click it again itll go back so you can you can toggle that switch back and forth got it okay i just toggleclientsales engineer yep and then just above the gear but you see the same visualization button if you click on that you can choose what type of visualization you want okayclientsales engineer but lets go back so this is kind of some look and feel and we can set up some office hours to do more data management  functions sales engineer but lets go back to the data tab because i do want to show you some other stuff in there as well before we let like pure end users go at this so youve got your prep orders the retail apparel demo is this something that it ships with i put a tag on it this morning so that we could differentiate between what you guys are doing and what ships your tag data management  functions ends clientsales engineer yeah thats my and so what we wanna do is go up to the ellipsis over in the far right around button there click on that and lets say lets create a worksheet and if you go to the left and create and click on sources i guess at the end up and then grab your table yeah prep orders close that and now if you open it on yep right there lets just say out of all of this there was only  or  records that you really wanted to give certain users you can not records but columns you can select them that you wanna use by double clicking them or highlighting as many and then clicking add columnsclient  or control and click the there you gosales engineer yep and yeah right because some of these probably you dont you dont i dont i dont know right but certainly lets also definitely pick a city state zip and countryclient leave it up for i end up selecting everything sales engineer now you can hit add columns there at the very bottom right below product you just lost itsorry thats all right yousee just belowclientsales engineerclientyup mitigate a few or they select that i can always come back and add to our rightsales engineer yeah but definitely do the geo ones because i want to show you something specific about thosegocity state zip countryclientsales engineerand product right right below product to see add columns right there youclienti miss crap quantity as well alright add columnssales engineersir outstanding now lets hit save button give it a namesales engineerperfect the other thing that you can do in a worksheet that i didnt mentioned i should have below the sources there was a formulas if i wanted to add formulas to this worksheet its just a spot that everybody that has access to this worksheet will now have that kind of global formulaclient doingsales engineer a one off in a report or an answer but in here you see right or the aggregate are the aggregations correct and then the next one is synonyms so partner name order number product quantity i can add in that synonyms column a comma the limited list of what people use and there every day verbiage to describe these things got it so yeah like search types clientsales engineersales engineer like the one i usually show is you know is it is it is it a fraud product skew item right you can just eliminate list and then the net and this is important for those non technical end users that you know what language do they use data drill down sales engineer and that just makes the search experience way more pleasant then for that auto visualization if you go over to the geo for state zip or country city obviously is is an endpoint to a drill in from a zip or something but for what where are we on i think it was state state whats that data drill down ends clientsales engineer click on sub nation or so yep sub nation announced stateclientsales engineeryep and then zip code and thenclient no we have lots of dirty data in here sosales engineerso defaults doubles its default as a measure when it comes inthats fineand then country yeahokaysave thatnamesales engineeraccount executivesales engineerclientand turn off phases measures since its the order numbersales engineeryeah yeah yeah you cannot change that to an attribute first and then d select additive and the aggregation its gonna tell you you need to change as well you dont have to go exactly in that order butgot it i safeclientsales engineersave and now if you go back to search right choose sources youll see in the top the upper part where it says worksheets theres your tests view and justclient yousales engineerselect the prep bordersturn this off okay data drill down clientsales engineerclientsales engineeryep and then hit close now your normal end users only ever going to see worksheets right okay and probably only one or two because were admins we see the entire entirety of it so now yeah you can open that up and if you say a quantity by country or something or quantity and countrysales engineer actually double double click it or type it right into the search bar i look at already you know and youre youre gone quiet and then country and hit enter i probably should have checked your we do that thats pretty coolclientsales engineer right and now just as a task lets drill down into the united states and go to stateright rightsales engineerhi click yeah i think we might have just gone tosales engineeralright so it looks like youve got state does that stateclientclientsales engineer looks like and then you know if you drill down to that you could even go to zipssales engineer and you only have one so if you switch over to tabular view its funny because i was literally just doing this the other day the same the same thing where it was only a couple of zips in the state that were in are there it is quantity three if you wanted to you could actually drill on this and go into like order number or item or product or or do we have vendorclient yeah so i guess my bigger question is like why did we only see state when we drill down from united statessales engineerlets kill this if you go to the x on the search barkilled all thingclientsales engineeryep and throw united states in there and our state through thrown state in there just type in state enter data drill down ends sales engineer lets see what we get here well thats why it says well you know why did we only see me a favor and say actually go down to state in the actual column here nope over over in the answer side yeahclientsales engineer and hit that ellipsis and just filter that i want to see something and actually you know what im gonna do im gonna just request control aswell yepi see what youre sayingokaysales engineerclientaccount executiveclientwhats the issue all possible values that show everything for the samplesales engineerread my mind right when i was sitting here slightly pharma and then i was like here we go this is probably why why its notwowthats pretty crappyyeahsales engineerclientclientsales engineerhes in here right my guess would be that its something to do withlets see this real quickso hes the auto searchsales engineersales engineersales engineeryeah itll be interesting to see how how it works with because im sure like you got em i state and there was mir up here multiple times so im not chit could very well beclientsales engineer it may it might have just totally confuse the map to a certain degree so it might have been a i would want to confirm what were looking at from a country perspective on quantity enter on this and lets you it its definitely pretty youre looking at it at the map though isnt it data drill down client  it is makes for a great demosales engineer absolutely there there may need to be a little bit of work on that and i can look at that behind the scenes as well not to get bogged down in this completely like totally take a look at this because i have access as im sure you know as an admin to this to this as wellsales engineersales engineerbut for quantity thats all you have seems does that seem odd based on theclientyeah i mean youre not filtering data anywhere so that seems really oddsales engineeryeah id have to check the data because it looks like right i just said show the underlying data when theres only two records for united states country data drill down ends sales engineer data drill down  yeahsales engineersales engineer right so you could actually we wanted to take this and see what the returns and third party vendor but this is exactly where its coming from so theres only theres only three records and then if i drill down to state here statesales engineerclient hi is this hitting third party vendor every time we see those sort of three bubbling dots yes and nothings getting cash anywhere its not like were catching up with data along the way data architecture sales engineer were indexing these values and whatnot but were not moving the data over and theyre not caching as far as i know name mayname right no other queries should be run in real time against the data thats in your third party vendor so you can paste those you can you know paste those queries directly out of our interface intoaccount executive  third party vendor and run them yourself there data architecture ends sales engineersales engineer is there maybe another metric that you guys use quantity stageclient quantity is the only thing i have another view right now i mean thats thats just part of that we look at revenue and profitabilitysales engineer yeah because its just theres i mean according to this theres theres only data for united states for state with quantity for those time periods we look at any quantity and what is it delivered day and production date is there a day that mightclient would they were you using just a new quarter create date thats the data to you working man june  clientsales engineersales engineer yeah something ill definitely have to look into because like you just like we just saw right when i true in that order create date theres plenty of data and data yepclientsales engineer and theres all the zip codes you can see its definitely its some its the one the one nice thing about this is without having to write sequel you can see the bad data right right and start interacting with it right so when i drilled into state why am i getting this up here and and this so i have a sneaking suspicion that its just the quality of the data we can obviously still work with it but it could be it could be sketchy from time to time here did not like apparently state except for the mapping data management  functions client you dont need to bog down in the mapping that we only have a few more minutes whats the i want to join a table you could just walk me through thatsales engineer yeah absolutely so if you had the joins done theres the top three in state if you had the joins done using the primary keys foreign keys in third party vendor and you selected those tables they would automatically come in as joined okayclientsales engineer if you want to join them in in company you see this joined button right here say i had multiple tables that we had brought in already i can just add those joins right here heres my source table select your other table whatever it might be and then select the column that it that it actually joints to you right obviously this table is not related to an all but you get the ideayepclientsales engineerand if its more of a compound join you can add columns here as wellclientokay and that just becomes part of this d normalized viewsales engineerit would just be joined on that to this d normalized view data management  functions ends sales engineerand then to to your point what you would do like this test view i would have to edit this and add that new calm i mean add that new okayclientsales engineer right so if i if i come out here and i add this table lets say itll itll add it but because theyre not joined its going to be great outclient got it okaysales engineer and heres the formulas as well you can come in here you can just start typing theres assistance as well whats kind of neat though is lets say i wanted to do a quick one as i start typing maybe ill say i want to do quantity see how it just starts popping in there like a leads leads leads leads the way so i can do quantity times i dont know product whatever it is and you have all sorts of different aggregate type calculations you can do count if some if sounds you have all your standard kind of if then else all that fun stuffclient heres a question just real quick on a formula to one is is there an assumed level of granularity that its calculating the formula on is it calculated at the role levelsales engineer yeah i believe so yes right so like it was interesting because yesterday i was dealing with a customer and they had used they had used this this aggregate aggregate i think they use the group aggregate for something and all that was was they wanted to take out they had fees and they wanted to sum that up slightly differently and literally all they had to do is say some if they didnt i have to do an aggregate if if you want to calculate add an aggregated level then you have to create that aggregate level right so its something from the transaction level on up across all of your all of your own attributes so if you need to do something more advanced and i need to calculate some so states or the zips are the cities whatever that granularity is in regional automatically go off the country right i want to calculate something differently at the country level then you need to use that aggregate kinds of functionalityclient okay so the second question on the formula is is that only relevant to this data source now that were its only relevant the studiosales engineerclientsales engineer this worksheet yes okayyes theresclientsales engineer thats correct and this worksheet is just a logical layer sitting on top of that prep borders table from third party vendor and its only attached to this worksheet or this test view as we call themclient okay so if i created you know client company good and gross profit as opposed to maybe our partners gross profit would i id have to do that in every worksheet that i created where were where were gonna use calculate profitsales engineerclientno way to really centralize our govern use of calculations across worksheetsales engineertheres not a concept of a global metric that you can just plop and pick wherever you want to worksheet right now use cases sales engineer its only at the worksheet level i believe thats on the road map but right now its only into worksheet levelclient okay well thats helpful i mean a lot of what we do centers around this view at least as it relates to managing our our backlog our productivity our supply chain but those metrics will apply and other places as well use cases ends sales engineer  sure yeah absolutely they always dok yeah okay i dont i went on our our time i whats the recommended way to really start digging in here and replicate some of the stuff that weve weve builtsales engineer yeah absolutely i mean essentially right you saw how easy it is to get connected assuming that we have our our account name correct yup,"{'polarity': 0.11582082366302898,

low,won,demo,account executive yep so ill kind of keep keep moving forward here so we can see a you know a little more features and capabilities of this here so what im gonna do is im just gonna go ahead and clear out of this im gonna exit out and ill just put in and this is this this im like demo instance if you what is a retail example but its still gives you you know an idea right data drill down account executive kind of on the on the data that youll be using so ill put it in sales lets put it in daily ill put it in region and ill put it in lets just say last six monthssolutions engineer the search bar here account executive that does using is is is our primary way to build things data drill down ends solutions engineer lets say if you want to build a report the search bar is usually the place where you would go to i would say you know search the answer for in this case all of those colors of the bills indicate what what entity is it data drill down solutions engineer so sales isnt green thats a metric so region as an attribute because its in blue and then the last six months has obviously filter so as soon as as soon as account executive types to query what company theres doing on the back end as to construct the sql query for you know for this search thing that you type and its its basically running and by your third party vendor instance on the flight theyre done in the results picking the best fit visualization and then displaying it to the you know to the user who searched for it and you know transparency is very important for us so you clearly understand which tables are we accessing then relate this query and also you know as account executive show the actual sql query that the agenda rating thats what does it make senseclient yeah thats pretty cool i have a question how does how does this handle data different granularity so like say you have sales for some you know for dresses added daily granularity and you have sales for shoes at an hourly granularity how does that like how does the end user know that when theyre searchingaccount executive glad you asked so youll see here daily right sales daily region last six months but i want to show you this so what i can do here like lets just take this peak right well grab a random peak ill right click on it lets say i want to drill down and i want to go to the city theres no predefined drill pass right so if someone wants to drill down they can drill down right so now it takes me here i in cities lets say i want to go step further i can i can drill down and lets say i want to see the skew number i can drill all the way down to the skew okay and i can keep going further and further and further so thats the powerful thing about company is being able to get to a very granular level extremely quick to be able to figure out like hey what what question i trying to answer search types account executive what you know based off that says i need to make i need the information now i can get there as granular as i want does that give you an idea there on the granularitysolutions engineer yeah client a part of your question is sorted by the keyword that the user types data drill down solutions engineer so lets say if they buy daily and it turns out the the product in this case process have the granularity at an hourly level you know theyre still that company is going to aggregated for the day and then showcase it but there was another way to work around this which is you can specifically tell company the only get the most detail level by default data drill down ends solutions engineer so even if youre by daily its gonna be done i believe thats something we can set on the back end but you know it i hope that answers your question its barking on the keyword and the data you know how what line that the data is it yeahclient data transfer client i think i was thinking more the kind of reverse scenario like what if somebody thinks data is available hourly does it just not show that option when youre searching or lets say they want to hourly but it actually comes in dailysolutions engineer  i mean if youre paying hourly it shouldntclientsolutions engineer okay by the hour but youre saying how do the user know if there was an hourly granularity is that what youre saying yeahclient yeah like say we actually dont have the data at an hour hourly you know greenaccount executive okay i if you dont have the data it wont be there right use cases account executive if if an hourly isnt something that you have there its only gonna be available for what you have anything thats in third party vendor thats whats going to be available yeahclient okay yeah because i think theres some well i think theres like a lot of assumptions that buyers add that because we get some data and like like for us in digital systems engineereting we might get like say facebook data and an hourly grain but we may only get removed or being at like a a daily green theyre gonna make assumptions that they can have everything hourly and i think theres gonna be theres some confusion around that use cases ends client so i dont know if theres any controls in place that just like say if they were to search facebook it will show hourly but if they search removed it wouldnt give them that hourly option in the search bartaccount executive i mean we can we can show them that on the yeah there is controls over that right on the semantic layer kind of the worksheet man if you want to show them that here in a second,"{'polarity': 0.09574148385946137, 'subjectivity':

low,won,company product,solutions engineer yeah what we can do that as you know track the usage behavior thats one thing so lets say you already im used to facebook hourly query before the next time youre type facebook into the search bar you know we track the usage so youll probably get a suggestion that says hourly search types solutions engineer so if you you know if you have that or what account executive is doing from the start like you can close out of the search bar account executive start diving from scratch observe how these usage base suggestions come up so then you type sales company based on the behavior of you as a user and grew it basically suggest these suggestions,"{'polarity': -0.4, 'subjectivity': 0.5, 'sentiment': 'Negative'}",-0.4,0.5,Negative,0

med,lost,company product, use cases account executive that would be fantastic grand i know weve discussed for the sake of the proof of concept and inventory management use case that was top of mind and timely is that still the case and if so can we you share a little bit more about thatclient in inventory in terms of its availability in the in the day like is is not there thats something that we have in process data management  functions client something were working on there are a number of tables that we need to bring in put it into our process layer and ultimately build a model and are prepared layer so at that point then we could circle back into the process layer and make it available for data like for the purpose of the po si data transfer client however we can we can do something that were doing in the interim which is to take from whatever sql servers databases which as snapshots of our inventory which basically has the kind of the pretty much the final set of data that were going to any way build only one from our native assets sql tables so basically simulating what would we have at the end of the day after we do all of our data engineering so and we do we need to do that anyway in order to pull the data in for historical snapshot so so that would be that would be our approach there use cases client but makes it easy there is that basically its one one big table that has everything already altogether so for the purpose of a plc we spend less time data modeling and more time getting and user feedback we also have some requirements from the team where theyre very interested in being able to take inventory data and combining it with forecast or demand or inventory you know comparing a supply forecast the demand forecasts data management  functions clientremoved  removed so these are all the other data sets that were building up but step one is getting access to core inventory data and that would again that would be our approach is to leverage what weve already built out pull that in and be able too you know show how it can be much easier to analyze the data that the business is used to using it instead of having to go and grab the data export it create more dashboards and so forth data management  functions ends client of course were were looking at a very much from an end user point of view i wanna make sure however that from an install point of view firms getting is up and running in terms of being able to get the approvals to do that were all on the same page so that way you know as long lead time so that once we get the business interest of this we dont want to put them on pause for six months you know its important that we are you know able to move quickly once once we all are on the same page data transfer sales engineer and is that the process today client you said they have to download data to an excel file and do some kind of shaping a modeling themselves and then upload that back to build a dashboard on top of itclient sure because what we have right now and our sql database is not something that they actually query and build the build anything and they have to move it to another place data transfer ends client you know its just basically a you know a  year old not even the day like its just a bunch of tables that are out there that they can query against and move them someplace else so its not very user friendly so what happens is and its happening all over the company people in the data thats a good place together data management  functions client they grab it they build their own little mini mini data towers and they go to work and then we have this proliferation of data models and no central us already or control so the idea here is now that we are building a video we do this from the etl and we have the flexibility to give users and easy way to kind of do what theyreremoved  removeddoing right now without having to do a lot of data modeling so thats what we want to prove out our plc dont go through that use a tool like this and quickly be able to to to do what you need to dosales engineer got it okay and that that one big table i mean can you defined big for me just logging scaryclienti dont have a row row count on this but i can get back to you on thatsales engineeri mean do do you know how wide it is as wellclientits pretty its pretty big i mean youre talking about youll be talking about all of the all of the inventory across you know the entire world i mean we have tens of thousands of skews we have you know many suppliers we have you know many manufacturing facilities you know distribution centers its a camp very complex network sosales engineer okay and so this is the table then that moving from the process so the prepared layer is kind of d normalized into a relational structure with the with the keys and relationships between them data transfer client well i mean this table this table is already done because this is are all kinds of sql environment its already been kind have theres already a process in place that when the month and take that take all that data create a snapshot of it and save it off into another place thats what were talking about here data management  functions client wed be kind of replicating that and and client by taking the native tables pretty much not adding a lot to that but just creating a a method going forward thats more sustainable and also being able to combine it with other data sets so but were not there yet to to be able to use that final end model for inventory but we can leverage what weve already builtremoved  removed okaysales engineersales engineer use cases  and i imagine given the size and scope of that table does contain all the different data elements that would be a part of any question and then use or would haveclient  operational inventory analysis yes okaysales engineername i have one question regarding the performance metrics what we talked about right data architecture name so since the compute and the data store is going to be data breaks the performance metrics is mobility clue what name has set right so what im trying to understand is is there any specific performance metrics company has to offer here because the computer is going to be on client the data is already organized on totally prepared as the platform is coming from the performance most of this off most of the tools or the bi tools right they have a computer engineering and the performance indicator is based on that but when you say that company has a performance indicate when you mentioned that youre compared with other tools i feel that theres more related to client with this the data store as of now versus the company software itself is my understanding right search types sales engineer youre talking about pure compute and processing time yes oftentimes when were talking about performance and speed as well were talking about speed for an end user to get the answer to their question as well so its and also i mean just to what client was just talking about about trying to reduce the proliferation of data across the enterprise and trying to kinda reduce
