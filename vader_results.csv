high,lost,customer base,client  its like you know people kept saying south now now you refer to as old terms like thats the good part like well i knew that a lot solutions engineer  yeah account executive  that all sounds great but also as you start to get you know further north almost to you know carefree thats a great area to  customer base ends  client  yeah its capital quarter spitting out its just snotty but you know its just me yes im an old town girl all right guys well i dont wanna hold you guys up too much good lets go ahead and get started and you guys are gonna record you said right we are okay thats good,0.9895,0.302,0.0,0.698
high,lost,agenda,account executive  yeah yeah its recording software ill share a copy with you afterwards so lets lets start with some quick introductions im account manager company bandwidth company a little over a year now and we first engaged with name i think prior i dont think hes with you guys anymore but prior to his departure he got me connected with client and then i think kinda right around when client and i first connected with when things sort of tailed off it which is probably when when wayne game you know or at least things started to move with on the wayne front so thats kind of ill give you a little bit more context client as we go but thats just a quick intro from the company side solutions engineer you wanna go  customer base  solutions engineer  sure hello everyone rabin solution engineer on the team based out of denver im also im relatively new to company ive been here about the four or fiveremoved    removed months now but my background is ive been in bi for about  years is client probably knows all too well most recently i was the third party vendor for eight and a half years and so my role is to kind of help account executive and the rest of the account team from a technical aspect account executive  hello hey solutions engineer im snameng dawn and when do you guys mind doing a quick intro client  what do you want to start  customer base ends  client  she was gonna let you call first because i think youll like what are the individual that ill just say yeah im good too or whatever client  okay so yeah i started with the client obviously december third so havent been here long im im coming in as the head of the head head of data visualization so kind of heading up the consumer tools so third party vendor installation so far and obviously then looking at other options you know for what are the other tools that are available and how can we if theyre more appropriate for a certain scenarios im certainly looking into the ai world and how we can utilize that,0.9898,0.138,0.024,0.838
high,lost,about company,client  so thats kind of a bit about me obviously ive been in bi for i dont i honestly dont know how many years but a lot and solutions engineer i have a long history so sorry thanks sir client  and im down and reading im lead data architect for for client and you know just kind of excited to take a look at some different visualization tools and and you know maybe see how how we can expand our our bi capabilities  about company ends  account executive  and six thanks byeremoved    removed client  and windy coffee yeah account executive i was you know part of the earlier conversations that we had is we were looking at visualization tools we we have completely restructured since then so my role now is is i have a team of data engineers were subject matter experts quote to cash side but when i look at this ill look at it for all of our data domains and we work with the business so were kind of the interface with the business and projects them using the tools then i guess things like that so account executive  fantastic so we will thats thats probably starting point  agenda  account executive  well do a quick kind of recap of of you know where we were headed originally on the client front and and then kind of get your take as far as you know how how we reset here and then well jump into the meat of the content which will be a demo overview of the technology  agenda ends  account executive  see so you can see where and how company might fit as you guys are kind of re prioritizing and your goals for  just real quick i know when do you youve seen maybe one demo client or client are you familiar with company at all client i know this will be my first time looking at it  agenda  client  yeah account executive  okay awesome client client  maybe you could point out you know maybe where your tool with excel over those tools im i dont know what the donner shared if you feel the same way kind of that we can understand you know meeting the value add on top of the tools that we already have client  yeah i mean i would im more concerned or im more interested in how it compares to third party vendor but then like alright is there like like it but then also the governance side of it right but like how do we is there a way to integrate it with ablation  fix so can i just said i want to add maybe a little bit of flavor to the conversation so we have third party vendor and i think one of the new things is we have a nation i think were gonna be implementing so itll be helpful as it goes through the demoremoved    removed,0.9979,0.178,0.015,0.807
high,lost,agenda,client  like how how can we like with third party vendor for example we can we can look at like the lineage of of data going into workbooks and data sources into third party vendor through elation and so wondering if theres like similar types of functionality functionality with company there like i said i think itll be a complement to relation but but definitely a a an alternative to to third party vendor  agenda  client  yeah and solutions engineer i know this kind of puts you in an awkward spot but knowing the fact that you have deep insights into third party vendor id really like to hear your pluses and minuses in that aspect so yeah perfect account executive  thats a great starting point so let me do this can everybody see my screen here solutions engineer  yeah we see it account executive  excellent so this is what we pulled together last time around so this is almost a year ago so so fairly dated and i know dont how long have you been with client nowclient removed    removed  for about six months account executive  much okay so you know when we were talking with client these are some of the areas that we were capturing and im gonna go through a couple of slides that i pulled from a you know a presentation that i think name did a long time or several years ago but just to kind of get an update from a tech stack perspective but where thought well i company was you know while we were initially engaged with name and then you know ultimately getting connected with client is the idea of enabling business user specifically and finance with the ability to ask and answer add hawk questions on their own without having to submit tickets to get new dashboards built so a pretty standard selfservice use case and the fact that you already have snow like in place was really the driving factor behind that because we have such a tight tech integration so i dont want to spend too much time on this slide because i think things have updated quite a bit and we can jump into this in more detail going forward you know  agenda ends  account executive  and i think the goal at the time was really this was a very much about getting third party vendor in place so that you can kind of have that underlying infrastructure from an analytics perspective this is the text stack as of  so i would be curious just to pause here real quickly to get your guys his take to see if theres anything extremely meaningful that we should know thats been updated you know over the last two years or if this is still a fair capture of of the architecture,0.9978,0.178,0.007,0.815
high,lost,about company,client  yeah actually were completely redesigning the entire architecture here so third party vendor will be in the picture but it will simply just be a data warehouse in a broader lake house architecture were going to be redesigning our data lake in an s using more open source big data technologies and then leveraging third party vendor for for kind of the the curated data data warehouse component of that architecture  data management  functions  client  so so less data ingest going to write or actually no data ingest going directly into third party vendor from the sources that law land and s were going to be using data bricks and spark to curate data along the data match principal and then taking the final data products that are produced in that process and and putting those in third party vendor and and those are working on were going to be used for analytics and reportingremoved    removed client  perfect and then just just to add onto that data catalogue is is now implemented with the relation so thats what were focusing  agenda  account executive  got it okay that makes perfect sense from any questions on on that piece solutions engineer  no not at the moment thats thats helpful overview account executive  okay awesome and you know again this is all this is going to be new as well but the real thing that got us initially interested interest was around add hawk analysis and so i think what well do now is is transition over to you know who is company what we do but i just wanted to level set there as to as to why there was interested in the first place from a company perspective and when do you feel free to chime in as as you were kind of you know involved in in the later stages of those initial conversations so moving forward were going to give you a quick overview of who company is what we do and then well show you a demo and then ultimately you know the text stack that you just described done still would fit really well with company  about company  account executive  and and well explain wise we here but at a high level company were now just over removed years old we were founded in removed and our founders came predominantly from third party vendor and so when they started the company there are a lot of dashboard technologies available third party vendor which you guys have power bi click etcetera but well wasnt theres the concept of searching enterprise data,0.9979,0.185,0.011,0.803
high,lost,about company,removed    removed account executive  from a technology perspective we have a lot of tech companies that are using thoughts but also based in area happy to provide specific use cases and customer examples that are most relevant for you as we go to that ill highlight here removed has  merchandisers using company these are non technical folks they dont know how to sequel or you you know write sequel code they dont know how to use third party vendor or third party vendor or traditional bi tools but theyre using company to set pricing at a purse per skew per shelf basis and then one of the reasons company was so valuable there is our ability to search data at extreme granularity with great performance at scale apples a little bit different  search types  account executive  theyve got their genius bar uses company to analyze iphone repair data and in some cases theyre asking theyre putting like  keywords into the search bar and asking questions that way too much more complex use case as i mentioned very tight integration with third party vendor you mentioned data bricks  data architecture  account executive  we also have a huge emphasis on them this year from a partnership standpoint company connects directly to either of those cloud data warehouses and allows you to query that data directly underneath the way you guys are setting up your architecture thus far would connect directly to third party vendor for from an analytics perspective and allow those users to ask questions of the data totally a couple more slides just kind of frame what you know the challenge were solving and then well jump into the demo what we found is that as customers like yourselves are making that journey to a cloud data warehouse leveraging you know ease of use the less the city low cost ,0.9948,0.169,0.017,0.814
high,lost,about company,account executive  we still find that about  percent of that data goes unused for analytics and really thats because of the traditional you know dashboard pipeline if you will where as a central bi team you guys have different lines of business that you support they come to you with questions or requirements the team then takes the that data curated cubes agnameates the data as needed from a performance perspective create a dashboard and then deliver that to the business and those dashboards usually well answer any you know anywhere from  to  percent of the question but theres almost always another question and so you kind of have this infinite process of of dashboard creation ill ill pause here real quick i know snameng your new youve got a lot of third party vendor experience though based on what youve seen so far at client does this look a little bit like how analytics runs todayremoved  account executive  we still find that about  percent of that data goes unused for analytics and really thats because of the traditional you know dashboard pipeline if you will where as a central bi team you guys have different lines of business that you support they come to you with questions or requirements the team then takes the that data curated cubes agnameates the data as needed from a performance perspective create a dashboard and then deliver that to the

dashboard creation ill ill pause here real quick i know snameng your new youve got a lot of third party vendor experience though based on what youve seen so far at client does this look a little bit like how analytics runs todayremoved    removed  industry issues ends  client  im still working into how analytics works today at client but definitely in in any structure thats how it works and it certainly problematic and in that sense but yeah i would say so when he is obviously more closely related to how the business process works today client  yeah and and of course im sure client has some feedback on it but i actually think honestly the queues and agnameates as missing  industry issues  client  i think its the data warehouse and then reports and dashboards are going directly to the data warehouse account executive  got it and when do you where does your team fit kind of of you know would you would your team be in between the bi team and one of these lines of business for or would your team be part of the bi team  industry issues ends  client  yeah my team as as part of the bi team so like like client mentioned were going with the new architecture which is really were trying to move the business out of the data warehouse area right get them at a higher level also some of the work that theyre doing we have they have chateau teams so were currently kind of like evaluating that and trying to see if what we can bring back to bi so so im kinda like that little person those little the bi team person right  customer base  client  i work with the channels i work theyll go to customer like four of our data is mostly third party vendor but it does have we do have like to j bow and some other applications so were working with the business channels and looking at their dashboards and then you know were doing so data management  functions  removed    removed client  ill say sustaining under the current infrastructure and then looking to work with client to start developing what those scheme as a model should look like in our new world which will make it easier for the business to find what theyre looking for and also you know add credibility to the data sources the data that theyre taking into the metrics does that does that  data management  functions ends  account executive  yeah that makes perfect sense done anything that you would add client  yeah yeah no thats exactly right i mean i think you know its always you know even even in our architecture theres always theres always kind of a bottleneck connect cubes and agnameates like were going to have kind of have a like like in this diagram like the data warehouse like is is kind of doing a lot of work here  data management  functions  client  at least in in in our architecture were going to have some flexibility where those cubes and agnameates or or easier to build but but at the same time like to your point like theres always a limitation there  industry issues  client  you cant build in in in in goober cube that has all the answers so so like you end up having a lot of overlap across across those cubes and agnameates and then you know but but but you dont have a way to have like a panacea answer to to all that  data drill down  account executive  got it yeah that makes sense and you know one of the things from a company perspective in youll see in the demo is we really encourage our customers to keep the data at the final screen available so that you can drill down and get to that lowest level of granularity thats relevant to the business industry issues  removed    removed account executive  and so solutions engineer will show you what that looks like but oftentimes you can help eliminate a step or two in the process and really open up its still a curated in terms of youre not just exposing the business to a  different search words so youre curating it in that regard but you dont necessarily have to do a ton of cubic and agnameating name anything youd add on that solutions engineer  really the only thing is that i mean obviously the the agnameating concept is is is done in traditional bi simply because of the the ratio between people that that build content and and the people to consume it you know its its attend to one approach and theyre attend to one ratio and so its almost agnameated by necessity to say look we cant build every individual requirement for every individual user so were going to keep it up or were going to agnameate it up and and and provide you know kind of have a a templated dashboard or report to as many people as we can to cast a wide net and then well provide   filters however many are are needed to let people drill down to the lowest level of granularity that has a performance impact just from a technical perspective but also from a usability perspective it means that people are slower to get to the information that they need and ultimately it means that a lot of times its probably not gonna suit them exactly which gets you into the cycle of okay if im an end user in this doesnt hit this didnt scratch the age that i need from a data perspective now gotta go through that process of making a one off request to someone that actually has the data back and knowledge of the tool knowledge to to give me what i need and of course well go back and forth and back and forth that may take you know hours days et cetera client  yeah one one problem that we we we have in that space and i wanna give like a very specific example but you know obviously it has broader implications is one thing weve never been able to solve cleanly is im in certain types of reporting you need to be able to do things like account distinct  use cases  client  so this makes a lotta sense and marketing reporting like i need to know how many customers ive touched with the email or how many how many first time opens and stuff that that have happened and so as you move up and down the hierarchy like look at a campaign level i want to look at the line of business level that that that calculation of like how many how many unique customers have i connected with,0.9991,0.121,0.027,0.851
high,lost,company product,lient removed    removed  it gets very hard to answer and so kind of where im going with that very specific example is is then that cubes and agnameate section either is woefully insufficient or you have a proliferation of a bunch of different agnameate tables because youre you cant you cant flex up and down the the hierarchy in a in a performance way  data management  functions ends  solutions engineer  blue yeah i mean it it brings on a whole host of client  challenges i solutions engineer  think account executive  so thanks for that adding that color name done as well and i think i want to kind of move forward so we can get you guys into the demo because i think thats what will be really interesting  search types  account executive  but from company perspective just kinda tied off here our goal is to leverage the work that youve done on the cloud data warehouse side and deliver to the business the search bar that allows them to ask questions of the data and then iterate on the fly and we will match your best fit visualization to pair with that search which will show you in a second,0.9368,0.106,0.016,0.878
high,lost,about company,account executive  what we found is this really drives adoption of of bi a good example is removed they had about  people using tools prior to thought theyre using power bi now theyve got over  people in a  monthly active users so it really it really helps drive business adoption,0.8297,0.163,0.0,0.837
high,lost,company product,account executive removed    removed  it also frees up the analysts to focus on less ad hoc you know basic you know answering have questions that come from the business and focus on more complex analytic problems ultimately what that looks like is moving from a you know a static dashboard on the left this more iterative search experience,0.1868,0.077,0.049,0.874
high,lost,agenda,account executive  im gonna stop snameng here because thats thats where well jump into the demo but please any questions while we transition please fire away client  im good so far client  extra seat okay solutions engineer  i think you guys are seeing my desktop now yes alright perfect so that you know as we get into company theyre really two two things to be aware  agenda ends ,0.9686,0.306,0.054,0.64
high,lost,company product,solutions engineer  and frankly i dont think that we move the needle very far within that i mean obviously theres still the same kind of concept to me the the true value proposition of what thoughts its bringing to the table is to be able to search data and as we get into the search if you think about it there is a tangible cost around creating a dashboard or creating a canned report even just a simple cant report,0.8519,0.141,0.0,0.859
high,lost,pricing,solutions engineer removed    removed  its gonna that cost is going to vary in terms of time effort resources actual dollar amounts in various forms but ultimately i take a step back and think okay out of  queries or  requests for data on a daily basis how many of them actually warrant that effort solutions engineer  you know how how many actually make the the juice worth the squeeze because a lot of times its an elephant going for mosquito type of problem because people just simply want to know something very simple where theyre not going to need to monitor that over time they just want a simple answer to get them through the next five minutes of their day and then never again,0.5346,0.087,0.028,0.885
high,lost,demo,solutions engineer  but but thats what tends to happen with with typical bi applications because thats the only way they have to actually access that data so for example lets take a look at the revenue lets look at it on a monthly basis and lets look at this you know lets actually just look at a particular store removed store number  we want to look at lets just say joey donuts and maybe yeah lets break it down by age group  data drill down ends  client  hey solutions engineer as you as you just went through that how did you how did those dropdown selections come up is that because of prior history or is that are you looking at i dont know what what what created that selection list so if you go back on age group or yeah i dont know if that was one of them,0.886,0.094,0.0,0.906
high,lost,demo,client  but this click back and so what whats generating that list right there solutions engineer  thats a great question i probably kind of skipped over that too fast this is well let me start by saying this is a live connection were always going to connect live against a third party vendor instance that has about one point removed of data in one of the fact table so its its not the largest amount of data but its certainly not trivial to say the least what we do is we this list is generated by two things since its most recently and theres a an engine behind the scenes that kind ofremoved    removed goes across what your own personal searches but also whats common off the platform solutions engineer  and its its always learning if you will the second thing is keystroke for keystroke so as we start to you know type in f its gonna do an automatic search against the index for hey frozen spinach friday yeah and as it starts to add the l its gonna go state flowers et cetera so this is indexing not just the columns within the database but also be individual values within those so the list of products the list of cities removed stores et cetera client  okay and im sorry one other quick question when you say its against the database so this is did you select a particular database or is it broader than that,0.9786,0.112,0.006,0.883
high,lost,demo,client  are you saying here is here is client third party vendor which has a number of different tables in it do you select that somewhere or i guess i want understand what great what level are we at here is this a single table solutions engineer  good question so what company is doing is before you actually execute any search youre going to set up the concept of what we call a worksheet  data management  functions ends  solutions engineer  think of it as a data source think of it as a a universe if you will its basically the four walls of the sandbox i had already had this one selected this one just called retail sales but that being said if you start with nothing it will start to do the search across various ones and you notice that let me see lets do this again you notice that it saying store state in retail sales okay so that retail sales the worksheet and how do we started with nothing you would have said hey we found state and retail sales we found flowers in a worksheet x et cetera  data management  functions  account executive  okay solutions engineer but i thinkremoved    removed client  they could join across data sets are these worksheets solutions engineer  you can every query or every search is going to go against one individual worksheet but there are ways to federate that at the at the live board level at the dashboard level client  okay is that like a mapping that we would set up then inside the application solutions engineer  thats correct yeah so basically the step one would be to set up the worksheet so then it has the appropriate tables and im shared i think i forgot one question that you had which is this retail sales model this retail sales worksheet has i think thats six different dimension tables and two fact tables and im happy to to open that up and we can we can show you what that looks like  data management  functions ends  client  i mean maybe continue on with this but i would love to see kind of the the premium yeah pre steps to get into this place account executive  yeah totally totally great point solutions engineer i think lets lets so right now solutions engineer is kind of showing the end user experience so lets get lets do that it kinda show him a few more things you name then lets show them under the hood connected to third party vendor and how they would create a worksheet solutions engineer  yeah of course and client i think did you have another question client  no no im good solutions engineer  okay well so what ill do is ill show you a couple of things here data drill down  removed    removed solutions engineer  and then as account executive said well well get into the back end but if you think about whats going on and i mean to get a user is going to look at a very specific type of question right costa mesa store jelly donuts et cetera that process of getting to that from a pre canned report or pretend dashboard where you got your your  or  filters on the top or the right hand side the difference with company is theyre just literally typing it in they dont have to go through that series of filters you know weve seen this a lot even just like you know manufacturing example where theyre a  skews right,0.9976,0.164,0.024,0.812
high,lost,demo,solutions engineer  and people who are looking for a very specific element of of the data right rather than having to go through three four levels of filters you just type it right in and so this this idea of search is something that everyone understands universally because were on yelp or on third party vendor raw on third party vendor throughout the day we just type in really the key pieces of information that we need and then company is going to translate that into the sequel so every search that you execute youve got the ability to see the underlying sql if you wanted to obviously you dont have to but this is kind of a sanity check to say yeah this is pretty much exactly what i would hope its gonna go against versus just kinda trusting it will you know blindly if you will  search types ends  solutions engineer  but the other thing is that that thats also different is every bi tool historically relatively speaking notice fairly easy to use its drag and drop well the problem is you need to know what to dragon what to drop and that can sometimes be a limiting factor its not the the technology itself,0.9443,0.128,0.049,0.823
high,lost,demo,solutions engineer  its the process because maybe people dont understand the data model right and and i i experienced this myself a number a bi expert itd bi expert ive worked with four different bi companies and there have been times where ive had analysis paralysis simply because i dont know what information is out there  industry issues ends  solutions engineer  and so rather than having to scroll through a list of two  columns obviously in this one its more of a scaled down version but now im not stuck because i dontremoved    removed have to actually find something to drag onto the view as a starting point i can start to type in see what actually gets generated for me the other thing to keep in mind is in this case we actually dont have anything called revenue if you notice in this list duck vertical theres sales and there so that theres that translation that says look revenue income net sales its all sales and on the back but i is the the end user i dont have to be exact or precise with what im putting on the view the synonym concept allows me to have a little bit of translation to bridge that gap and so therefore this idea of a data pain on the left hand side which is historically the the the the prerequisite for any any reporting that you do its there is a reference but its no longer a requirement if you will its a crowd to more than client  on on in this view is there the is there a mechanism for like say for like a metric like for for revenue or something can can somebody add or or modify calculation here like the like you would be able too and third party vendor for example solutions engineer  you can so if we come in here to the ellipsis youll see theres add formula and and its gonna you know kinda be the same dot type of dialogue box where weve got various calculations and and functions that we can apply and of course even just the some of the details on on what that syntax is gonna look like you know so itll show hey if you if you put it in this format of the function and then the two parameters that you can put the input it will it will obviously generate that and then itll show up basically that would be a another section as soon as we created a formula down here that says here your formulas and of course you could you can bring those into the view as well and you could even kind of hard code this into the worksheet itself so it doesnt have to live just at the at the search level client  is it like from a governance perspective is there a way to kind of limit that functionality by user solutions engineer  there is yeah so basically you can you can really turn on or off this this add formula based on that that user capability or group capability wed also have the ability to apply this at a real levels apply the role level security,0.9899,0.098,0.021,0.881
high,lost,demo,solutions engineer  so that if were looking at this you know im only associated with the west so all the data would be paired down to total include west data that that fits that criteria so that just also hard coded into the worksheetclient removed    removed  awesome account executive  cliente you can do the same i dont know if you saw the download data option that can also be taken away based on permissions,0.6597,0.075,0.018,0.907
high,lost,company product,client  yep okay yeah and that and that makes sense solutions engineer  and you know kind of taking a step back i know that one of the questions was how this fits in slash competes with something like a third party vendor frankly again based on my experience what ive found is its weird to say the two almost go hand in hand because really this type of question that ive asked its probably not something that i want to monitor over time right its very important for me because ive got a meeting in  minutes and i want to get this answer after that meeting i dont care about this anymore and so the idea of going to a report developer or someone they can create this in the in the tool if i dont have the expertise to do that i saved them effort of actually creating that and how many of those  queries on a daily basis fall into that category where its simply just a one off its not worth the effort to create a dashboard or report it connects me right to the data element that i want to see and now all of a sudden that workload is basically eliminate its not just reduced its eliminated from the bi development team because this is not something that needs to be monitored over time it doesnt qualify for something its official as as a report and i think that that number that percentage is like   percent if not more about the the the questions that people ask throughout the day and whether or not they need to see them over time client  hello hey solutions engineer i think i know at least a part of the answer to this but im gonna put you on the spot here and ask you to equate this to ask data and double,0.8895,0.085,0.031,0.885
high,lost,about company,solutions engineer  yeah yeah its a great question so i mean the funny thing is would ultimately need to go from from third party vendor to company is i was reminded of earlier my career when i was working with removed and this is around the time that third party vendor came to start to be kind of a dominant player in the marketplace industry issues  solutions engineer removed    removed  and you know at the time removed had visual insight right which in the course of a  minute demo wed spend maybe three minutes on that digital insight piece saying hey yeah we check that box as well see its pretty cool now lets get back to the real task at hand of determining what your enterprise canned reports canned dashboards et cetera needs are  about company  solutions engineer  and so theres theres kind of a lot of by the symmetry between that time in the market in in in where were at today which is you know power bi has at what is q and a or answers third party vendor has asked data and i go back to the idea that account executive i i dont know how many customers we actually have,0.986,0.175,0.0,0.825
high,lost,pricing,solutions engineer i think its like  but every one of those  customers that basically bought and implemented company because of the search capability and if it doesnt stand up and then were dead in the water i dont know how many folks are how many organizations have implemented s data,-0.705,0.058,0.112,0.829
high,lost,company product,solutions engineer  but in in however many there are if the ask data piece doesnt stand up theres still the core functionality that third party vendor provides that they can they can whether them and so its its kind of like third party vendor and yahoo right the idea that you know one disappear because of the infrastructure behind it because of the effectiveness of it  search types ends  solutions engineer  and i mean its simply just a man i will say this if you have that data its certainly worth to look to see if it fits your needs just from a fiduciary standpoint youve already invested in the platform but what weve seen is more times than not people actually use us with third party vendor,0.9581,0.16,0.017,0.823
high,lost,about company,solutions engineer  i think its removed that has removed category managers that are using core third party vendor with asked with company even though theyve got asked dataremoved    removed  about company ends  account executive  yeah sure and i think did robs point if you get if hes like would you see and ultimately you want to test company we encourage you to do it side by side if you already have asked data and i think i think youll see the difference in first name,0.875,0.174,0.033,0.793
high,lost,next steps,client  okay cool yeah yeah sure wed wanna take it at least that far account executive  yeah solutions engineer as far as you know lets say this is a an answer that you have for a meeting later today you may not want it for a long term you know what we call live border dashboard but you may want to save it just for presenting purposes not shown that kind of workflow solutions engineer  sure so we we kind of leverage the concept of pending so i think at one point we had these referred to as pin boards in much the same way that pinterest kind of works and so lets just say we wanted to create a new one of these and well call this our sample ill delete this later but we can add this to that particular pin board and now weve weve got that available and thats really more of just a container but so as we go through and and find some insider we drill down to whatever we want to zero in on lets say you want to drill into the product full name and youll notice the search is going to be a the search status bar is going to update hey now that weve got another answer will will pin that and this will just be kind of a running collection of the information that we want to to keep track of and so then of course we can go to our live boards and open it up and are all like i said it will kinda continue to have that that example there solutions engineer  i know we did want to take a look at the back end and now i want to be sensitive to time  agenda  solutions engineer  are there any specific questions and of course we can always set up another session we can always revisit these but i just wanted to kinda ask the question before we get into the the back end piececlient removed    removed  certainly want to take a closer look at this obviously will probably would like to do an onsite demo  agenda ends  client  so i can actually do some side by side comparisons but i am very interested in seeing the back end side because i think one of the biggest issues with any data in any company is you know you send a user here how did they know even what to ask the question on like what data sources are they asking on so i dont know client if youve experienced that here but certainly been i might have passed but how would they know to affect retail sales solutions engineer  i see so basically we we tend to think of a worksheet is kind of an area for business and so and there will be some overlap from one to another but the the nice thing is again you can just start with the generic search and itll itll tell you which which worksheet it and that element of the data exists and the other thing is we also in in account executive you might have more details on this than i do,0.9907,0.1,0.026,0.874
high,lost,onboarding,solutions engineer  but one of the things we do as a new customer comes on board is we help with the onboarding process to train certain certain subset to users so that they know how to use the tool they kinda know a little bit of a semantic model and and and help them through that process to kind of help you get further along in your in your development account executive  absolutely so so snameng a good example everybody a company from a sales perspective uses company to analyze our you know whether our metrics whether thats you know first meetings or plc or you know stages that kind of stuff and so when its rolled out to sail the third party vendor theres a you know we have a worksheet that we are assigned to to begin with  onboarding process ends  account executive  for example solutions engineer has mentioned also something we have called search assist where and this is something we can show you we dont have we probably wont have time today but basically on a per worksheet basis you can set up search assist where when i enter the platform for the first time i have a guided search where itll say hey type in this keyword type in this keyword type in this keyword this is going to give you an example search to get them startedremoved    removed  onboarding process  account executive  so theres a handful of different ways that we that we can help make sure that the initial experience for users is curated to the point where it that you know you get him going they feel comfortable client  real quick from from a governance perspective is it so like to to clients point like you know how how do i know to use a particular data set,0.9933,0.146,0.0,0.854
high,lost,company product,client  can we leverage the the that mapping as a way to have governance right so so like if it to all of the users of this platform you only have access to certain data sets and and we get to pick what those data sets are by mapping them in in in into the application so you can have some business user just go find random date out in out in the data warehouse and and and use it solutions engineer  absolutely as you can imagine we use this internally and even though you know were were the data culture and we encourage people to search it will obviously their their hr data sources or worksheets their finance worksheets that hi as an individual contributor have zero access to  data management  functions ends  solutions engineer  so i dont even see them show up let alone see them show up and you have the data restricted so thats essentially done on a worksheet by worksheet basis to determine what you have access to what you dont even see et cetera client  and just real quick does that tie into active directory or yeah solutions engineer  yeah so so we pull in those those users and groups that way yep cool there was one other point that that account executive reminded me about im done i know you had a question around kind of customer accounts and everything so if you notice obviously you know this is just a list of our dimensions that are measures lets just do a quick a unique count and you notice that that keyword so their various keywords whether it be versus are top or things like that lets just do a uniqueremoved    removed count of customer and do unique kind of customer name and then we get our our answer generated that way so even though theres not a hard coded measure for that weve got the ability for the end user to come in and just use that unique count keyword to get what they need,0.9752,0.098,0.013,0.889
high,lost,demo,solutions engineer  and then of course if we look at that on a weekly basis so this is just another keyword of breaking down that time based on the date field that it hits weve now built the chart that we need so again if you think about the idea of someone wanting this particular piece of information for the next  minutes  data drill down ends  solutions engineer  they dont have to go through a dedicated resource to get it they dont have to know sophistication of how the interface works with the drag and drop or a menu item literally with a a list of keywords that you can reference in the full documentation is right there that list them out thats kind of a cheat sheet to get exactly what they need without having to know anything further  agenda  account executive  so i know were at time here and we didnt get to the back end snameng client when he does it make sense for us to schedule a follow up session where we can kind of do more of an under the hood technical deep dive alright time well i  i if solutions engineers available we can keep going,0.4417,0.06,0.036,0.904
high,lost,company product,solutions engineer  yeah ive got another  minutes yet client  yeah i was gonna say its   i see this   i guess your time is that client  yeahclient removed    removed  i see i wonder if client  on my calendar but i can do another  client  gotcha yeah awesome yeah account executive  okay well let lets keep going up  data management  functions  solutions engineer  awesome alright so we have a we have a third party vendor instance and lets see here wheres your procurement dataset we want the new retail so this is essentially the database that were going to go after you notice weve got in this retail data set we have two fact tables six seven dimension tables give or take this basket back back table baskets fact tables the one thats kind of the the key window you notice its just over a removed of data so lets just build up a new connection from from the start so lets come in here and were going to go to our data tab  data management  functions ends  solutions engineer  now again as an end user you wouldnt even see this data tab at the admin or the development tabs even exists so this is just something that i as an administrator have access to and im going to set up a brand new connection so good connections and say add a connection and lets see here,0.9907,0.173,0.0,0.827
high,lost,demo,solutions engineer  let me just do some copying pasting here so it will do my connection or call this the client connection you notice that in this case were just gonna go directly get third party vendor like i mentioned before this is all live connection so were not going to extract data were not gonna store it,0.7096,0.113,0.0,0.887
high,lost,demo,solutions engineer  go and well just hit continue so theyre really kind of two steps to this i mentioned before the worksheet theres the connection and the worksheet restore the kind of the connection phase thats basically where we just select our database our tables that are involved in the columns that are involved so you notice that this list of databases is exactly what you saw in the in the pain and and third party vendor but were just going to pair it down to that new retail database and lets go to retail im actually gonna start off small so lets just pull in our basket backs table baskets back table and our maybe our product dimension so lets select all these and again this is not pulling in the data this is simply just putting together a reference of of the tables and the columns that are available for it and this is mainly just to so that we can generate the the appropriate sequel strengths as needed for example you know in our fictitious case we dont need the region information just yet we might add it in later so well just remove that from even a view of us company having access to the tables when it comes to joining tables when it comes to generating seek what were just gonna assume that region west south west south et cetera dont even exist in it and well just create that connection  data management  functions ends  solutions engineer  so then the next step would be to create the worksheet and thats really thats the magic later that says hey look a tot underscore sls is going to be sales and you know were gonna put some synonyms around that now i should also preface this by saying that this particular cloud environment is something that myself in  my colleagues around the country or or utilizing on a daily basis as a demo environment see youre gonna see some some an environment that probably need some house cleaning so what i like to do is apply a tag so lets go to and well just say rl example i can type and so all im gonna do and this is mainly just so that itll be easier for us to do a search later  data management  functions  solutions engineer  is im gonna apply this tag to these tables see here account executive l example and done so now that weve done that we want to create the worksheet off of that connection so well say create a worksheet and this is where we choose our source of the underlying tables like i said this is why i apply the tag you notice theres a lot of similarity an overlap just because everyones doing this all the time so im going to pair down to just those two facts just the the fact table on the product dimension table that weremoved    removed had we had included so weve got our our now want from a to make available to our users  data management  functions ends  solutions engineer  and this is where well well start to do a little bit of clean up to say okay good we dont need the product key twice you know sales dollar amount lets go ahead and rename that folks make it sales make it cost im not gonna go through these on a on a on a full basis because they they you know need to belabor the point im sure you probably understand that and say say well call this our client worksheet solutions engineer  and heres where we would apply this afternoon so weve got sales over here we replace and then that says revenue or income and maybe on skew number we would put you know maybe item or whatever the case may be and then well say save solutions engineer  now at this point were essentially done from a from a back end perspective youre done im gonna duplicate this just so that we can have access to it if we need to modify it or refer back to it but now our users can start to query in in more importantly the indexing starts automatically so if we come into search data let me see tell you what im gonna do this im gonna clear out this retail worksheet or this retail sales worksheet and im going to start out with nothing and so lets just do a search on revenue and you notice its starting to populate this with hey weve got a geo dataset geo data works youve got the retail sales retail banking worksheet solutions engineer  because this is a fairly lengthy environment this might take a long time to actually find a oneonone lets see here i might have already gone through it or not found it i would imagine that your environment would not have nearly the the volume of this is is we do just because weve got so many people creating the same examples over time client  okay it goes back to my last yeah goes back to my last question does that that initial sort of is that i think he said it was by populate so its its learning right so its by popularity and something else i think when you first started solutions engineer  it is yeah so here let me clear that out and let me find the client there we go so im just gonna kinda hard code this for now just because i dont know if theremoved    removed indexing is gonna take take effect immediately or not get rid of that geo data bear with me okay yeah there you go get rid of that okay but now whether weve hi is it still there whether we arrived at the added automatically or just by default im not clear that it did not client client  the demo solutions engineer  yeah exactly exactly so now that were there weve got our client worksheet and lets just start typing in revenue and again so that synonym concept is already applied and if we do that search if we look at the sequel we see that its actually going into the new retail baskets back people like we should so even though its not called sales or type of revenue its called sales its doing the right translation to apply to the right column of data within the within the the fact table  data management  functions  solutions engineer  and as we start to add in some elements of the data so apples for example the indexing is already kicked off the individual about and so now we see the same thing on the the queries the sequel query its basically the same queries before only its now applied that product its applied to join  data management  functions ends  solutions engineer  and its also added the the filter criteria on the product element if you will and of course we can go back into into the worksheet and add those other those other tables in and and so forth and so forth and so forth client  a quick quick question on the sequel at generates is it is it is it very specific to the system that its its query against,0.999,0.11,0.004,0.887
high,lost,company product,client  so like is it is it optimized so likely if you query third party vendor is it optimized for third party vendor or is it doing a little bit of kind of generic sequel that you know wed have to worry about some performance issues againstsolutions engineer removed    removed  good question so it is optimized per per data source or per underlying database so the if we were to set up the same type of model on data bricks versus third party vendor versus a gb queue or whatever it would be youd probably seal of discernible difference in the sequel based on the engine thats find it and thats built into is essentially the driver that we that we leverage but we we tailor the sequel and we optimize it per platform and then of course because if you think about where the the heavy lifting is done because all were doing is generating the sequel and issuing are issuing it to the the underlying database it means that theres really only you know one throat to choke as far as optimizing performance and at that point its more at the database level,0.9185,0.112,0.032,0.856
high,lost,company product,client  okay in in and another question do we need to be conscious about like things like table hands like you know setting columns to not at all or no or that type of thing or is or does it handle that fairly gracefully i know so we weve had some issues with like third party vendor sequel optimization because of stuff like that where you know we need to add table hands we probably wouldnt normally add for for a data warehouse because its like third party vendor gets overly conservative on on how its executing sequel and then that ends up being a mess solutions engineer  interesting i have to be honest im not familiar with the table vince content are you able to elaborate on client  sorry not as table hansel is the wrong word like column like things like a no ability table hints as wrong database the but but things like no no ability for example like if a if a if a column can be no or not right  data management  functions ends  client  so so if its not specified third party vendor well well well do something where where it does a bunch of no checks and the sequel as well so like if you if if for for example like if youre if you have a value that could be no like you dont want to show necessarily show know in a filter dropdown solutions engineer  right okayclient removed    removed  and so when it executes that sequel it does like a whole bunch of extra code to to to handle those situations whereas like if you just put this column can be now or can or cant be not know like you wont you wont do those checks like it itll skip that because you gave it you give it enough information and the detail of the underlying table that you know that that column cant be no also want to do those the that extra generated code solutions engineer  i see is so you do have a couple of controls are levers you can pull here one would be as you see here theres suggest values and search and again i think theres also kind of a step in between as you as you go through the worksheet creation process and say look lets really curate this to make sure that that things are optimal for the user experience so you know one of the things i was working with another customer on it is for a lot of those no field that we can create some calculated fields or formulas to instead of populating is no you can just either do a yes or no or you know whether its something as true or false or the example that i was using with the with the claims data was they had a field on auto rent discount and that would just be a no or not no so we can put that into a formula that says hey look no water and discount versus auto rent discount right  agenda  solutions engineer  that thats kind of one way around that and then of course the ability to suggest value isnt it its not this sort of value those are kind of two of the ways that ive seen to to handle that client  okay yeah that that makes sense solutions engineer  sorry go ahead account executive account executive  hello good good im sorry solutions engineer  no that was it i was gonna say i know were were kind of running up on time i just wanted to obviously open up one more time for questions and and take it from thereaccount executive removed    removed  absolutely so it team as far as next steps go im happy to if we need to schedule another session share it with a broader audience get into more specifics whether its on the use case basis or on a you know more technical questions,0.9979,0.19,0.069,0.742
high,lost,next steps,account executive  happy to to do that generally speaking from here we would start talking about what a plc would look like getting company actually in your hands so you can connect to your own third party vendor environment data bricks environment and tested against your data client  i i definitely like to set up a you know an onsite demo would actually start to play around with it  data architecture ends  client  i can work with you account executive and solutions engineer and obviously when you ill include you in done as well but i think we want to just take a look at it and kind of get her fingers into it and see if account executive  yeah yeah absolutely and and shared when you say onsite demo i mean like actually in an office or client  no its on the online okay yeah i would like i would like to try and take it and connected to our data so account executive  okay yeah yeah real excited there client  i dont know what offices i dont ive sold all my work close i dont know account executive  well lets do the shared,0.9923,0.26,0.022,0.719

high,lost,small talk,csm  alright im gonna have to do this before like sales engineer sales engineer  come across us so i have in a webex but not zoom okay we may have to spin up a separate zoom since account executive is the host csm  i can do that client hopefully thats all right i can shoot you over a quick email or if youre have access to the chat ill just drop it in the chat here just give me a minute to spend wanna  onboarding process  csm  im gonna have to leave and start the so im going to send out im going to send out an email right now and lets make you can hear us lets say client  its working now wait sales engineer  just csm  needed time sales engineer  yeahclient removed    removed  all i needed was you the threat of you leaving and then i just added or i think were good  small talk  csm  cool hows it going client  yeah nice to meet you guys as well no i think my videos even back like that was super weird csm  yeah that is weird well i know these things pop up different platforms client  yeah this is a new computer for me i got it about three weeks ago and so i hadnt brands zoom on it before where i ran zoom on my own computer  small talk ends  client  so it took a minute im wondering if it had to like download the zoom ap but the zoom fraud or the zoom i guess maybe it isnt i dont know it had to download it so maybe thats what it was doing and i got stuck in the middle one i didnt want to ought to have any audio until it was done i have no idea  small talk  csm  yeah good well weve got you now so first off client where are you based out of client  kinda like state so bottom right hand corner of the state of state csm  okayclient removed    removed  live in area county so im putting five minute commute into work everyday csm  yeah client  pretty pretty recent better these days with so many people working from home or is like not even a traffic concern which is pretty awesome csm  yeah yeah then the wall to wall or a few times i got a lot of family out in city visited watch i havent seen in a while now client  said your city area right is that correct csm  im not no so our colleague account executive he was unable to jump on the call  customer base  csm  i think he was the one doing most of the communication with you he is based out of city but with that lets just ill do a quick round of introductions here so im csm solutions engineerson and the customer success manager for client for every subsidiary that they have for it csm  so they own our product and im just responsible for and do you getting as much value out of it as they can and then with that i have our technical counterpart on the call so sales engineer feel free sales engineer  yeah client im the solutions architects so csm and account executive is technical counterpart im based in city stuff ive made my way to well well and kinda like a few timesremoved    removed csm  nice and yeah our is the new account manager so hes probably hes a third person that participates in these unfortunately hes on this call but you got you know two thirds of the team here so i think were good to go but with that give us a bit of introduction himself client  yeah so ive been with the formerly start with cascade right like that was the first option i get to work for utility been with cascade and client now for almost  years varying levels of responsibility but started in the in the ditch and then was able to work my way up  customer base ends  client  so i was i always joke was the last meter reader the cascade ever hired and i think thats totally coincidental but after me they went to an automated program like normal more meters so it was its been a good fit for me ive really enjoyed working for both cascade and and view  customer base  client  you know i remember back when we were sold or when we when they announced the employees are still in the union at the time you know we were going to be on the market and you know like you never know right put up or what thats gonna look like and we operate but state state who knows and i had never heard client obviously they came calling and purchase this and it was probably the best thing that ever happened to cascade so maybe before myself a lot of opportunity and so i really appreciate working for them but you know they just have done a good job of of managing utility as a whole so about a year after they bought us theyre buying a mountain gas i should probably do that but you know thats in idaho based utility that was about the same size as cascade so i can catch csm where youre where youre from or where where are you reside these days csm  yeah sorry im in the bay area client  okay yeah so you know we would still pale in comparison to but we are a gas and electric utility i think you probably know that as well hello romanian customers combined but we have a humongous footprint right which is probably our single biggest hurdleremoved    removed  small talk  client  i always joke i dont think everybody thinks its funny as i do but i kinda calls like everywhere else guess like we own everywhere else that nobody knows about like if its like an obscure kind of little town we probably on it and we dont have a lot of big hubs outside of city you know mount vernon you know kind of north i five court or and then the south i five sound or south sound at bremmer   customer base  client  kinda that bottom piece of the of the the sound our our three biggest like its been clienting and then is mark themselves but aside from those like kind of central is a lot little town so from for me what their current role so you know i was director of operations for state state and director of ops wash state idaho and then about two years ago they recognized we needed more of a quality focus across the eight states they wanted a unified program and so i was given the think technically now ive had couple of job change our job title changes or like im director of quality management system so that would include all your quality elements would fall under me so the beauty for that for you guys is theres lots of data lots of reporting that really comes from all of your quality work so we are a mix to to your program weve weve partnered up with lucas view to do the inspections and become the digital platform  customer base ends  client  that is you know electronic inspections were using it statistical sampling approach which is different than the industry that would you would normally talk to like if you were a pg pretty pretty progressive and kind of on the cusp of this element themselves so as enbridge theyre out of country but most of your utility groups in nation will assign number of like an inspector to a number of groups so if you are inspector csm you might expect me and sales engineer and another crew and thats what thats gonna make up your day right on your balance between the three or four or five however many youre assigned to and that effectively keeps you in the proximity of their work all the time and it helps you to stay plugged into the work that they do and its not a bad model but would it becomes very labor intensive you know you look at eight states of coverage and what that would look like for us as a utility group we have one  inspectors right here right its not very practical number when you start talking about fts so when we were asked to create a quality program we kinda had a we got a blank canvas and we can kinda pull it off and say however you want to do this you can do it so we get a lot of research and a lot of kinds of soul searching if you will and looked at and the table american national society of our inspection they create you know basically lot sizes depending on the criticality of the part how many times you should inspected and so weve built anremoved    removed inspection program based off of that which will allow us to have regionally based quality representatives and the concept is we broke all of our tasks apart so that we can see a task and us and the steps inside that they are tied to any one crew theyre tied to a geographical location they try and get as many inspections inside that region as possible to meet our quotes so the quotas are generated monthly so that you can say hey for this month i need to see  of this job and hes five of this job i need to see  of this job and so again as you start to kinda see the the lane im in here create a mountain of data which is all really good stuff but what we need to then do is kinda manipulate the data if you will to show our effectiveness and to show how consistent we are what is our accepted fail rate so you know we we view a task  times in the month of june and we get you know a  percent you know we passed you know basically like you know its a solid see is that good enough or not right depending on the criticality of a task than the the month of july we might do  inspections in that same tasks and well let the numbers from them dictate whether or not we need to continue on that on that great are we need to bump it back up so its a very floating scale so that it keeps your the minimal amount of resources dedicated to inspecting capturing data and really being as flexible and fluid as possible so what we do with an assigned like kind of back door i started with my story here but i sign number of inspectors to accrue like a one two five ratio we need  inspectors across eight states what were looking to do is to have about  field resources and probably about  folks behind the scenes pulling the levers and managing the data that comes out of that just because it is pretty comprehensive managing what we call our qmm or quality matrix or quality management matrix the tool that helps us decide what one were going to see all of that stuff is although very automated client  it does take kind of subject matter experts to manage it and then all of the data when we find something wrong so theres a lot of parts and pieces outside of what were talking about but where company would probably play and indicative role is the element of the dashboard in the presentation of all that data thats captured right  small talk  client  so when weve looked at its a saturday were married with lucas view for three years so were about midway through our contract they told us initially im sure you guys will appreciate this that their tool can do anything we want as amazing dashboards you know make us toast in the morning and you know you know senior solo buys in the evening small talk ends  client removed    removed  it does it all we got done with it or we got through configurations and the you know like the like our resource needs and we could could quickly determine that their tool wasnt going to be sufficient enough for the dashboards like it does everything we want from an inspection perspective cant deliver on the dashboards i live so where they came at us with hey weve got this partner called third party vendor which client resource group does use its pretty minimal and a lot of third party vendor use and theyre like hey wed like to use tool for your dashboard so weve

high,lost,about company,account executive  and this is what were seeing most of our customers some of already done at some are doing it you guys are evaluating sent apps we also connect directly to data bricks so thats a place where we could potentially start since you already have that in house but despite the fact that the investments being made and and more easily and cost effectively managing the data theres still that gap and actually using the data for analytics and getting you out of it  data architecture ends  account executive and we find thats because of what we talked about a little bit earlier which is which is this typical dashboard pipeline where our business group as a question it comes into the central bi team and then its about alright,0.8717,0.073,0.0,0.927
high,lost,company product,account executiveremoved    removed  lets take the data from the source lets model it maybe we have to keep an agariate it because the you know third party vendor or third party vendor i cant handle that much data create the different hierarchies et cetera and then eventually we kick out a dashboard or report or the industry average that we always quotas just under five days but nobody i talked to turn them around that fast so i dont i dont know whos doing it that fast but somebody is but the reality is theres a lot of dashboards out there that answer the question that you need and then you have another question and you kind of end up in that infinite loop so i saw you not in your head so im assuming this this is familiar to you  industry issues ends  client  yeah and the the central data services team that you know are being asked it to deliver develop these things and when they cant keep up that means you know all the departments go off and try to do it themselves which is created those links server craziness things that i told you about so yeah account executive  exactly well and i think from company standpoint we we want you guys to spend that time for our customers to spend the time getting the data right so that its trusted its covering in central and then you roll a search bar out to the business units and you give them their worksheet which is our semantic layer which ill show you when we hop into the demo account executive and so essentially a supply chain has their own worksheet or or multiple worksheets depending on how many groups you have marketing has their own but its all coming from a centralized data repository snaps data bricks whatever maybe you have multiple and youre using something like a removed to sit on top and do federated queries and that sort of thing  industry issues  account executive regardless theres a centralized way to get to that data and then company is enabling business the nice thing is you can you can really limit what they have access to by giving them starting them with less keywords so they dont get lost and they dont end up making decisions based on misinterpreted data,0.9707,0.089,0.024,0.886
high,lost,about company,client  so theres an api calling it dumps at all to that spot and then in turn i dont know what the relation is from third party vendor to get it from there but sales engineer  yeah gotcha so the main reason i ask that is because historically company and company client you had to move all your data from whatever the source system was into company engine to run your dashboards and that was not the easiest process and what is changed with company in the last couple of years and csm i dont i dont know how much client is using embrace but we now live connect to data where it lives if its in the cloud so if you said hey were using third party vendors database getting up and running with company is a lot easier then its probably historically been for client  data architecture ends  client  that makes sense right i found that would be probably the coincides with some of the feedback that we got right sales engineer  well where the challenges you have with third party vendor client  i i think did put it plainly was resource driven right like they didnt have enough people on their team to work through just the connect connectivity with just the connections between the data points that were were inspecting and wanting to measure and and creating that dashboard like that were just kinda they werent going to where they were supposed to be and so the dashboard was just basically incomplete like it wasnt getting built with live data felt like there was just a manual process behind the scenes that we werent necessarily a part of that was part of it i think some of it actually was the apple ios update was a little bit of a hurdle for them initially in the communicate all of our all of our work is getting done on apple devices so i think that was a bit of a hurdle i think they were i think there was a lotremoved    removed of resources dedicated to making sure that as the data got up and they came from the cloud that it would be recognized and i know there was lots of conversation around that i said i i should stay more plugged into this stuff and i really super track all of those guys do but like greek to me sometimes so i really do try but i dont get it so i know those were the two of the biggest hurdles obviously with the iso update thats kinda behind this now for the most part i think everybodys working through that  next steps  client  i think that was probably a larger hurdle when they let onto believe and honestly ive got a meeting later today to talk about where were at with with third party vendor and im im curious if like i said i have occurred in about a week and a half since the last time i heard hey its working again no worries its doing what its supposed to be so  next steps ends  sales engineer  gotcha client  i havent heard since then so you never know often cautiously optimistic is doing lets suppose csm  yeah well i think its its interesting just with what you have set up and i would say thats a thats a bit more modern than what weve seen across you know client in general which can take it a lot of the advantage of some efficiencies that we built into our newer deployment the other interesting thing is the the mobile piece so if you all are using i pads or you know any ios device like that that we have a native app that plugs into you know any ios and can be used in the field and actually thats thats a big use case for it and its very its very dashboard focused and so gets filled folks on there i pads iphones the ability to you know filter and use dashboards that are you know built in in like kind of the web browser version but then would be displayed on the mobile app so it sounds like there is certainly a fit here but im curious like that conversation that you had flagged one what didnt flag thing company it was a good fit for it was it just the size of the data client  yeah and the dashboard youve got the dashboards where the most flexible for what i want itremoved    removed  yeah csm client  and that they are currently grade and maybe lucy im not sure who all is on the t he told me great are working for the our ease the reach our regional directors are you using the terms but the folks that you know so you have district managers over a town all those guys report up through a regional director so theres a ticket or initiative in place to create that are these kinda one shop stop dashboard that shows them both the compliance information for maximum and the mapping information from every right so like you bozos like that would have been super handy to be a part of that conversation or youre plugging in your compliance information or your quality information with compliance stuff right like so instead of a two part dashboard it would be a three part dashboard kind of feels like the yeah that too for that one like weve talked about like getting ourselves kinda plugged into it but thats all company period right so like thats a company dashboard here it comes to this third party vendor dashboard how does that work and does it does it play well i dont know and thats why i say i think that ones probably ship the sale so what i think is probably important for us all to keep in mind is lucas you have a good corner on the market we are actively looking for a construction solution for as building right and it could very well be overview it may not be in look a few may stay for construction and we migrate our inspection over to every like thats a possibility we we evaluate that because we pay a pretty expensive israel license every year but the reality there was they didnt have the resources that client to give us a call or people to create what we needed to do for a little bit so thats why we went to this off the shelf solution of lucas field so theres that was in the next three years thats why its a three year term it would be too busy to start something like that so weve got well well use lucas view kind of prototype bandaid you know get a stolen and prove and disprove some of our assumptions about our process that weve wanted to create this you know kind of a new way of looking at inspection and so far its been a good a good partnership and im really pleased with them but the reality of it is going to come to a conclusion and were gonna have to make a decision as utility like do we keep keep our wagon switched to look with you or do you spin off and recreate some of the same elements and every and probably something like company which are you know pay pay for licensing csm  but that decision probably wont happen for another  months if the client  yeah id say your way csm  yeah cool and then does does flatter gray kind of have any i dont controls kind of the wrong word here but like control over like what tools whichremoved    removed groups use or do the groups make the wrong decision kind of like client  yeah we have a steering committee and the steering committee really has the authority to say yes no im a part of the steering committee so as lab the reality of it is when when this went to the steering committee right like they had to before you would go to the executives they had to have like the steering committee his blessing and so the steering committee blessed it because they knew we didnt have internal resources to do anything else so i think thats an important piece to remember there csm  yeah no this is this is good and i think this is a good conversation started run a couple of minutes over time here ,0.9998,0.194,0.023,0.783
high,lost,onboarding,csm  so well wrap it up right now but you know this is kind of especially from my perspective im looking to grow you know higher footprint within client so just hearing the stories and you know from other folks and other other businesses within client of pilot up and you know eventually well start working with kind of the the labs in grades to get other pieces up and running on company  onboarding process ends  csm  so obviously the times not now but just know this is there and now theres a feature for this and just stay plugged in because i think thats the point like just comparing between what you would get with third party vendor looks view or you know any of these other tools with what you get with company no i think that would be good so you know come that  month timeframe you know putting the running for it client  yeah and i think even if i could talk and it it might be a possibility like if i could talk them into creating a third leg of the already dashboard that is quality information in company and then you know we could be running the third party vendor on it be a little a little silly to have them in parallel csm  rightclient removed    removed  even if we took like some high level stuff and made it pretty quick and easy so that you could get a pulse of your region or your district quick and easily from that one dashboard and then if you wanted to drill into it more you could go to third party vendor i think that would be a great use case for us to start the test whether or not we liked the third party vendor version of it versus the company version of that like id be totally willing to do that if name an environment to give us a you know a quarter of the screen so to speak and that one dashboard csm  yeah so what im curious though well how like how quickly would you wants to do that would you be interested in like starting on off next week or is that sort of like a next year thing youd be looking to do  onboarding process  client  id be willing to start if i could get the green light to get a part of that that dashboard ticket id be fine with starting next week but im okay with that i probably you know id want to double check with my team thats not gonna muddy the waters for our deliverables  onboarding process ends  client  but if we could provide some in in kind of work in parallel a little bit like why wouldnt we track like why not get the information where its easily attainable for the end user going to a dashboard every day csm  yeah client  that csm  im thinking about this from my name and blogs point of view as well  data architecture  csm  because i know one of grades initiatives is you know he wants to see and do you start to migrate more to the cloudremoved    removed  yeah client csm  and theyre theyre fully briefed on kind of the the thought the how company setup to yes work better on the cloud for client  yeah  data architecture ends  csm  welcome to get good explanation there but yeah that might actually interested from them too and that might help your cause in terms of you guys are running this an third party vendor yeah we can connect to that and its i think its a good test for both sides like client  yeah csm  pretty good glad to be like yeah how does company work with this and then client are you youd be like yeah this this tool is actually you know kind of worthwhile and if it mitigates kind of those previous ideas of you know company been a little clunky with getting data in you know i think thats a good thing,0.9995,0.232,0.007,0.761

high,lost,company product,account executive  and this is what were seeing most of our customers some of already done at some are doing it you guys are evaluating sent apps we also connect directly to data bricks so thats a place where we could potentially start since you already have that in house but despite the fact that the investments being made and and more easily and cost effectively managing the data theres still that gap and actually using the data for analytics and getting you out of it  data architecture ends  account executive and we find thats because of what we talked about a little bit earlier which is which is this typical dashboard pipeline where our business group as a question it comes into the central bi team and then its about alright industry issues  account executiveremoved    removed  lets take the data from the source lets model it maybe we have to keep an agariate it because the you know third party vendor or third party vendor i cant handle that much data create the different hierarchies et cetera and then eventually we kick out a dashboard or report or the industry average that we always quotas just under five days but nobody i talked to turn them around that fast so i dont i dont know whos doing it that fast but somebody is but the reality is theres a lot of dashboards out there that answer the question that you need and then you have another question and you kind of end up in that infinite loop so i saw you not in your head so im assuming this this is familiar to you  industry issues ends  client  yeah and the the central data services team that you know are being asked it to deliver develop these things and when they cant keep up that means you know all the departments go off and try to do it themselves which is created those links server craziness things that i told you about so yeah account executive  exactly well and i think from company standpoint we we want you guys to spend that time for our customers to spend the time getting the data right so that its trusted its covering in central and then you roll a search bar out to the business units and you give them their worksheet which is our semantic layer which ill show you when we hop into the demo  data architecture  account executive and so essentially a supply chain has their own worksheet or or multiple worksheets depending on how many groups you have marketing has their own but its all coming from a centralized data repository snaps data bricks whatever maybe you have multiple and youre using something like a removed to sit on top and do federated queries and that sort of thing  industry issues  account executive regardless theres a centralized way to get to that data and then company is enabling business the nice thing is you can you can really limit what they have access to by giving them starting them with less keywords so they dont get lost and they dont end up making decisions based on misinterpreted data industry issues ends  account executive removed    removed  so you can kinda starting with training wheels and then as they come back and say hey we need thats very easy to add an attribute measure a column and get them access to more data as they go so we can talk about that what we really see and removed which is like the removed country,0.993,0.094,0.016,0.89
high,lost,about company,ccount executive  we roll this out there and they had  people using bi tools now theyve got removed that are users of company in there and may their monthly active users like removed so we see a ton of adoption because its a lot easier to use  search types  account executive this is when we think about like if youre going to deliver a search experience whats most important is the user variance its gotta be fast its gotta be snappy and its gotta be intuitive and so what company is doing under the covers is were indexing everything so you user never searching searching in a vacuum and so youll see they can drill down to that find this level of granularity on the fly query engine table stakes of converting a sequel to english but we can do it at massive scale we understand very complex queries and we push a lot of the work down to the underlying or the majority of the work to the underlying cloud data warehouse and then lastly were cloud agnostic born in the browser so users are accessing it through a browser and weve got all the security functionality youd expect from an enterprise platform im happy to address any questions here youll quickly go get over my head in which case will pull into my engineer  about company  client  hi im following everything youre saying so yeah i appreciate it and i do have i would say some familiarity with sort of this full augmented analytics plugins to some of the bi tools and im glad to see that thats not whats really going on here account executive  yeah no there are cases where as users are as companies roll company in like removed did this at first where they had all these dashboards created for on third party vendor  about company ends  account executive  but if you wanted something beyond this there was a link that took you to the same data model and allows you to search all that data in company thatsremoved    removed thats a way to do it most of our customers will just pick a use case on company and just do all company though im going to show you what this looks like now,0.9907,0.113,0.007,0.88
high,lost,demo,account executive  so let me escape out of this and jump over here can you see my screen here yep alright so when you when you get to company and how many right now im in a less technical business user i will have pinned some of these and this is just a demo environment for retail sales data but ill have pin some headlines here like maybe im a you know a sales leader for the northwest and i can see what our revenue was last month or whatever it is im looking at pipeline et cetera maybe its on time removeds full removeds capacity you know whatever youve got some headlines here that you can track and weve got monitoring and alerting capabilities so that hey we dip below a certain threshold this is now in red when i come to my screen or i get an email alert or whatever some of that basic functionality which you see down here are trending visualizations that have already been created by another user and youve got some trending over here  data drill down  account executive  theres two ways to search company fundamentally the one that ive been describing is searching the data and so if i jump in here and say i wanna see sales monthly im typing in these keywords and its producing it will produce a visualization on the fly and ive got some options over here that i can change but will based on what you search well put what we think is the best fit visualization and then lets say we want to look at this maybe lets add by region and as you can see as i pull this up in this case i type region but lets say i started to dive deep you can see everything that weve index is going to come up below here but as you use it more its going to elevate what we think is the most relevant based on that user so if i come back here and start typing region again you can see this clock is showing hey you use regional lot thats why we brought to the top but also available on revenue reversible jacket et cetera et cetera so lets say we pick on region we ago and now again best its gonna make the adjustment on the fly as a user  data drill down ends  account executive  this is what we call a worksheet so you see retail apparel over here this is what i have access to so i can search city date latitude longitude region sales et cetera these are the things that ive been essentially that have been exposed to me as a user and ill show you how you treat that data drill down  account executive removed    removed  but the power here is once im in no i looked at as i say okay interesting the midwest is the top performer we had a spike here this is where i can right click and drill down and now i can explore this data at any level of granularity that i want to so right now were looking at sales monthly by region maybe ill want to better understand what are the stores that are driving this and so we pull up stores for the midwest we only want to see the top five and its like you and if you do top itll just naturally go to  but in this case really at the top five okay michigans our best store and now lets see it by product whatever i mean you can just drill all the way down to the lowest level of granularity we also acquired a company called seek well which allows us to then take lets say this is a relevant or a meaningful insight  data drill down ends  account executive  its all about just because you have the insight doesnt really mean much now its about taking action from a business perspective so seek well we can actually push then whatever the insight we have is back into the business application so if its a lead list i can push it back into third party vendor and now my sales rep has a crm they can go talk to her or maybe its a customer support representative at client these are the list of whatever unhappy customers that are happy customers you know whatever that we need to go content so were still working on that its called custom actions we acquired the company about six months ago but thatll be fully rolled into the product over the course of the next year kind of closing the loop on analytics client  interesting very interesting account executive  hi client  im curious about that curating piece of it that you mentioned account executive  yeah absolutely,0.9976,0.126,0.026,0.848
high,lost,company product,account executive  let me let me show you one other thing here and i dont know if this is lets just go back to theres a search bar so sales monthly and well go by region just pull up the same search here the other thing that we have is called company product and company product is our ability to basically run an analysis thats going to pull up this is iremoved    removed guess im doing it for the first time on this demo but you can see were going to basically run an anomaly detection against all of these different parameters in the background and what that will result in is something like this where you come over here jump in we can see what this person ran it against lets see sales increase two point removed to four point three and so what were gonna do is hi chris anomalies that we think drove that and in this case you know there was a zip code though is higher than normal state et cetera do you think about this from an airline perspective maybe there was really bad weather in denver and so there are a bunch of removeds that were delayed and that may be obvious but maybe theres some another insight thats thats not as obvious you can provide that feedback and over time were going to provide were going to learn and give you better insights  company product ends  account executive  so this this is basically this isnt gonna replace the data science tool by any means its more like lets give you a place to start so that you can go kinda kinda do a deeper dive from an analysis perspective alright i know we only got a couple of minutes left here  data management  functions  account executive  so from a data standpoint as i was mentioning we have what are called worksheets so if we jump into this retail worksheet this is where company is curating the data so weve taken all of these columns and weve loaded them into we may have you know in this case is a pretty simple schemer that weve created here with with a few joins  data management  functions ends  account executive  and then this is about making the data readable so it may come in as like product underscore type underscore you know whatever its going to be some sort of database less pretty name here i dont have editing privileges in this demo but i can come over here and i can actually change whatever the column name is if theres different synonyms that we know our users like to search by we can load those synonyms in here you can put multiple in this is where you can do some of the more technical stuff as well come in and and you know provide some of the more detailed work here agenda  account executive removed    removed  and this is where you know if youre interested in this piece we could get my engineer involved the other thing that we can show you is actually how we connect to the cloud data warehouse its pretty simple process but but its a powerful demo to show you how quick you can test it out i do wanna show you one other thing any questions on this before i jumped to the last piece here,0.9902,0.086,0.017,0.897
high,lost,demo,client  so to set up this worksheet this model so to speak you you have to go in and figure out the join the or is that sort of of inferred account executive  we will inherit any of the work that you guys have done at the cloud data warehouse level so if youve already created a lot of this logic were just going to pull it in and well map to it but we connect to the tables within the data warehouses and then once those are in company if you need to add a join we can do that at per company layer if you want to add formulas we can do that we best our best practice recommendation is to do as much as you can at the cloud data warehouse level so that number one youre youre not putting as much if you have better performance but also so that you can utilize that work that youve done it for other tools and other areas client  right right yeah and thats yeah the warehouses for traditional dimensional model star fact scheme of types of things but a lot of the operational reporting is still very much relational joins and all that so a lot of the models are already developed yeah as i mentioned ill probably be taking the lead on met a data management and so we dont have what ill consider a good data cataloging tool to just sort of scan the data sources that are out there and and make sense of them and do some of the curation like what you were just talking about you know in in that you can do and some of these met a data tool so i was just curious if you work with other meditated tools or you just go directly to the sources account executive  yeah so open api so if a if a data catalogue company wants to you know pull information from company into the catalog no problem we are working on a more comprehensive integration with companies like elation for example or collibra but what company can do also and you can pull this in from one of those or you can write your own in here data management  functions ends  account executive removed    removed  we also have what we call company modeling language which makes all the script double but basically you could jump in here and you can add a description again i dont have edit privileges here but you could put what this product what the description is and if youve already got this all on a spreadsheet we can load it in you know we can bulk load it but this gives you at least so when i when i then him and i dont see any descriptions here so yeah i can see it but you can basically once youre in the interface searching you can hover over it and its gonna pull up the description and say hey here heres what this word needs client  right account executive  both but were not trying to replace a data catalogue mandy means our our future is more integrating with those client  okay good account executive  and then i know were a minute over you got you have another two minutes client  i do yeah account executive  okay so the last thing i want to show you is this and that is once youre company customer and youve had company for six months say theres a lot of content out there,0.9944,0.116,0.026,0.857
high,lost,about company,account executive  and this is where we see a lot of customers run into trouble with existing content in like power bi or or third party vendor or anywhere and so we have both the the search the actual data component which is this data you know which is what i showed you earlier where youre actually searching against the data search types  account executive removed    removed  this is actually searching pre created content so i could just search like show me sales last year and its going to pull up all this one happens to be word for word but its going to pull up whatever weve think are the best fit based on that and then you can come over here and you can say yeah this is actually what i i think this was i going for it is cool and then you can jump in and to the chart and actually go look at it so lets say that wed want to jump in here company says dashboarding today you know from a marketing standpoint the end of the day company is suggesting you use search to build your your pin boards we call them  pinboard  account executive  but same idea as a dashboard so once you have a pin board or a search saved you come in here you can share this out with any users that you want to collaborate on these you can follow up et cetera all the things that youd expect that probably bi tool  pinboard ends  client  very interesting yeah thanks thanks for taking the time to show me all right i i think there is potentially opportunity at client for this type of of products timing is everything no unfortunately for thanksgiving im not sure what what would be ideal is i think after this exit data the snaps proof of concept which i think is tentatively scheduled to end like middle of october end of october timeframe if i understood correctly if if that once we have some data and snaps so to speak that is sort of our data might be very interesting are powerful demonstration to come in and and show whats possible on top of our data right and i think that would potentially absolutely lines from from some of our executives key player here just so youre aware would be a gentleman named dan or debt  customer base  client  hes the managing director of the analytics the strategy team he actually he reports up to sandy stelling whos the vice president so theyre actually not in it theres for their own business oriented analytic team and hes the one that runs the data science program as well but sandy is is pretty much one of the key players in terms of the value proposition around analytics and strategy for the company account executive  thats great thats thats very good to knowclient  how are my organization reports up through the stress name and boost the managing director of the common services and hes the one thats in charge of the data warehouse team and the middleware teams that are you know building out the the warehouses and the some of this theyre just getting started really in the data lake and doing things there okay so the combination of dan and suresh are sort of the two key decision maker for something like this just so youre aware thats good to know whats up this rush and the enterprise architecture team uses purview okay awesome,0.9983,0.168,0.026,0.806

third party vendor data directly for their subscriber and content use cases and then im with the overall ecosystem recognized by gartner as a visionary an analytics the last three years were coming in and this new way of of of what they called augmented analytics and strong partnership with all the cloud providers a specific to third party vendorremoved  removed customer base account executive theyve actually invested in company with their venture portfolio arm and theyre actually customer to company so analytics is a part of their architecture im starting with our title organization initiatives and were expanding use cases into their sales team as well data architecture account executive and name will show you we have a purposely built connector thats optimized for third party vendor environments so thats a really great fit for us we do have other connectors with like third party vendor third party vendor big query snaps data bricks and star versed but i would say third party vendor as our our largest connector across our customer portfolio about company account executive and then i really liked to highlight our customers a little bit more in detail because all of these organizations have a mix of bi technologies theyre typically pretty mature third party vendor third party vendor click view organizations as their enterprise reporting tool and theyve theyve brought in company and how we complement and differentiate search types account executive and they saw the value in a few of these things number one ease of use through natural language search and having a tool its actually intuitive for business users sequel thats automated so youll see this in the demo but that really helps in addressing the challenges of users who are not technical to be able to get questions answered themselves industry issues account executive and the great use cases that we have is when theres a lot of add hawk questions around large complex data sets and like to emphasize the importance of of granularity of the data for decision making and youll see this throughout throughout the demo but with company we eliminate the need to to need to agarieate in summarize and cube all of your data so so when i say granularity of the data getting to a very very specific level whether thats you know product id customer id to really be able to make decisions off of off of that analysis and whatremoved  removedthis ultimately as resulted in is this shift in paradigm of users need to solely relying on data teams so when were working with bi and analytics organizations as our the i just we kind of talked about we help in solving for that bi backlog which helps with bandwidth and being able to focus on other higher value activities at a common scenario here from customers you know theyll get a dashboard or report that drive several new questions they need to go back and forth with the data teams because maybe it wasnt predefined and you know depending on the priority that account executive days weeks so company really empowers users to ask those add hot questions of the data themselves and example of this like well work with apple and when they looked at bringing in company they look to quantify the cost of each dashboard that they created so the amount of time and resources theyre putting into request that that helps kind of these orphan dashboards that like maybe were utilized once or twice for very add hock question but the amount of time that their data teams are putting into each and every one of those dashboards they they found value in in bringing in company to be able to have those add hot questions answered in a power users themselves with the who will use case like i mentioned its theyre describing content teams who are who are not technical its its their analysts theyre marketing finance that are looking at you know top performing series monthly and weekly engagement subscribers industry issues ends account executive what are their top performing name was by content on this subscription side its a lot related to like age and gender engagement how their new subscribers are engaging for each campaign and again the users of this are not technical and dont know how to write sequel so that they they really have didnt have a way to just answer that on the fly themselves search types account executive last couple of slides what makes company different and youll see this in the demo brought to life by name but again all about user experience which ultimately drives adoption users have a familiarity with search in their

high,lost,demo,clientsales engineer awesome well great so to set the stage a little bit more im going to be were walking through a demo data set around media data this is actually very similar to how who who is using company today with their subscriber  use case so a lot of the things that account executive just mentioned youll probably see you know come through in this demo data set industry issues sales engineer i like to start here in you know what it looks like to most folks are pretty familiar place a dashboard right company actually calls this a live board in most bi tools this you know a static dashboard type experience thats often an endpoint for business users im in company pinboard sales engineer the live board is different and its meant to be a jumping off point so what i mean by that  here with a live board is that theres no dead ends as an user i canremoved  removedexplore an existing visualization and then i can apply my own filters driven by these smart ai suggestions data drill down sales engineer maybe just over the last six months i want to see our our number of customers nothing that has to be predefined as i either you know apply my own attributes here instead of by gender maybe i wanna look at my age group right this didnt have to be put into a filtered list or pre programmed into this dashboard industry issues sales engineer im able to then explore that answer more fully without a predefined hierarchy like you would have to do and kind of like a third party vendor or a power bi so i can hop to any point in the data that i want to using that initial visualization as just a starting point right search types sales engineer so this is a really nice way for a user to start their day within company and again kind of jump off from there but really the core of the platform and what were very well known for is search so you can think of company kinda throughout as really an answer engine data drill down sales engineer its on top of your cloud data warehouse this is super useful for a user who has maybe a brand new question that wasnt pre baked into that dashboard you know they started their they often maybe its around you know customers maybe the number of customers that signed up in the last couple of weeks based on when they started lets grab maybe like  weeks and ill just start typing my question right search types sales engineer and then maybe well look at this by region what company is doing here is as i type that match rolling which question right into the search bar there its going to translate that into something the database can understand so we can see the the sequel thats generated on the fly here to an end userremoved  removed data drill down sales engineer they dont need to know that right but what company then does is returns the results of that query back in the form of a best fit visualization right based on the shape of the data it picked a line chart the user has a lot of flexibility to override that choose their own chart type pinboard sales engineer and if this is something thats interesting to them they can save this in their own live word and you know create create this as kind of a sandbox to store insights and answers as they go so ill pause there any any questions but so far from eitherclient this is this is a very cool the the fact that then you could search like regular search how is it possible to define a weeks like,0.996,0.122,0.017,0.861

high,lost,company product,sales engineer but typically if its something like you know just a dimension table its its like an attribute that youd want to index you know those dont change all that much right its mostly the fact tables or you know the the metrics that are changingbut thedefault is  hoursokay thanksclientsales engineer industry issues clientsales engineeryeah so again im going to shift shift gears here the the business user isnt going to have access to set up a connection themselves this is going to be in the hands of the data expert right but typically this is done kind of in advance and then you can you know give the business user or something to self serve with with very limited you know kind of the initial time spent to do thissales engineer the first step is you know choosing your cloud data warehouse im gonna just do you know a quick example here where you choose third party vendor and then you could input your credentials so im gonna just select these ones that i have here data management  functions sales engineer and then both plot is going to go out based on those credentials pointed at third party vendor and show me the data objects that i have access to so in this case im gonna bring in our retail apparel is just an example dataset for this connection and then we can select these raw tables that we want to start to cure rate and expose toremoved  removedusers so as i make that connection again company is not moving any data you know within company this is just creating pointers to those tables within third party vendor itll then inherit any joins any primary foreign key relationships that have been defined at that third party vendor layer so that you know company can then know how to navigate those tables on the fly when a query is sent by the user so you can see thats the case here we have we couple of joins that were defined within third party vendor and company inherited those obviously if this is more complex data model you know you can start to tweak that if if that wasnt to your liking you can add a join all that good stuff right here within the ui data management  functions ends sales engineer and at the table level youll notice again the this is an exact representation of how the data is within third party vendor right weve got the keys weve got kind of the the cryptic database type names right you could expose this to a business user or you yourself as the data expert you could search on this table that yourself but often times you dont wanna you know do that for your business user community what im gonna do is then tag these tables and then start to create that worksheet that semantic layer on top of it so ive got my own tag here for name and then builds a worksheet on top of this data management  functions sales engineer so this is really kind of the the main step here for the for the data experts is going to be selecting which tables do business users actually need access to and then from those tables ive got a lot of columns maybe they only need a a subset of those right data management  functions ends sales engineer maybe just product type product name store name region and then ill ill throw in a sales and a date field so again this is just gonna be a subset from those that that one fact those two dimension tables and then i can also add any business logic here in the form of a formula so activision blizzard theyre a customer of of company they have a very custom metric called our pro which is is revenue per user per player right so they they dont have that defined within third party vendor but they have a custom formula setup that just performs that logic and then a business user can just type in you know our approved by region and theyll be able to be able to get that answer as they search data management  functions sales engineerremoved  removed so this is again just the test worksheet for wednesday im gonna save this and again you can see that because the sits on top of those raw tables i still have the underlying data model intacct right company knows how to join those tables on the fly when i ask a new question data management  functions ends sales engineer and then here is where i can you know start to pretty up some of the names maybe i want to add in a description this can kind of act as data dictionary or you know even a a data service right a synonym its something really important in part as part of this worksheet in that different users across the org they might call the same field you know revenue in one area sales and another our pool and another right pinboard sales engineer this is a way that you can just add in all the all the items that a user you know might use to call it by and then once im happy with those changes i can save this share this out to my user community right based in groups i can give them just view permissions right pinboard ends sales engineer this can also be interacted with programmatically if i wanted to make a bulk change i can edit the company modeling language that underlies this via api or you know using the ui here and then you know and then im good to go so when a user logs into company they would see hey you know name is invited you to use this data source and i think it was worksheet wednesday right that we created and from there they can you know add in a field maybe they want to see this again by by region and then also by type so the first thing they see when they come in the company they see this data source and then they can start searching on it immediately because of all the work that you did to get this this worksheet you know and im kind of business user friendly shape so i know we went through a lot there with kind of the connection and then bring it all the way round the searching on that as a data object is there any questions or the or the jclient the the plays very you  of the name thats where you would add any new logic like if you want to add a custom field with the different logic thats where you would addsales engineerremoved  removed yep exactly so you know if im trying to think of the is there you know any metrics or kpis you guys can think of that you know you dont have necessarily find in third party vendor that you would want to want to create heresales engineer any kpis come to mind this is where you would do that though like if you had any you know if you want to do sales divided by quantity get the price per unit or some sort of different logic yep exactly so price or something like that that can be saved within within here and thats going to be a a formula that a user would be able to search on got itclientsales engineer so you know hopefully that ties some of it together on whats required on the back end obviously this was a simple example and you know sometimes its an iterative process where you go back tweak it you hear hey maybe one group uses a different synonym to call you know a specific field something and you can come back and add it you know if it makes sense for you guys i can show then what you know how this would come to life with the developer functionality and some of the embed features unless theres any other questions or thoughts on the account executiveaccount executive i would love if you dont mind our team we just fantastic here i i apologize i wasnt on the first few calls but you didnt mentioned earlier selfservice is something that youre like looking to drive is their broader initiative around is this some you know pretty big theme and beach body or is it something that kind of is maybe something that is is a priority just curious to get your take on on where this sits in the organizationclient its definitely do see where where it sits in the organization plus also we we kind of see

high,lost,about company,account executiveclientsales engineer im not going to get like all into the product im gonna get into basically why were different okay and whats the difference with us and the idea is that companyremoved has their architecture other tools have their architecture were built with from the minute we started building our structure from the idea of search driven by search so meaning that user is going to primarily use a search bar or answers that have already been searched in and retrieve to interact with data so if i have some simple retail sales here right so its i can ask question about this and so a user if they wanted to say hey i need my sales and i wanna see that,0.5267,0.037,0.0,0.963
high,lost,demo,sales engineer lets say i want to see that for state where i live here and i need to see it for last month and i want to see a daily they ask that question like that company address is going to give me my answer back to me like that right its gonna pick a chart itsgoing to send it back to me i can toggle between the table i can toggle between the chart i can change my chart so we do have a lot of bells and whistles but as i said this chart isnt going to have all the functionality that youll see in bi tools have been around  plus years right data drill down ends sales engineer our main thing is the idea is you ask a question you get the answer back and when i mentioned remember earlier i talked about cloud data warehouses the reason thisis work so quickly for us and is that this question here is a user asking in their terms me i know hey i gotta look at sales towards the last month,0.4215,0.034,0.0,0.966
high,lost,demo,sales engineer i wanna see that daily so i use business terms company translate that to the data language sequel sends it to the source im connected to third party vendor in thiscase it can be a other other connections and it gets the result back instantaneous so the key thing that i like to think about one of the thing about company is if im a business user and i have a question right industry issues sales engineer im going to have questions that the other  plus users probably different from them right and if i want that answer i dont wanna have to wait a day to get thisanswer maybe my question is okay let me look at the most recent day here let me drill down and see what it was wherever i want here right,0.7717,0.073,0.0,0.927

high,lost,demo,sales engineer i now see something else waiting another day i lose the value of my answer and thats what company is is the ability for a user to free form ask questions andget their answers so thats a lot more we can do the demo but i just kind of want to pause there see if does that resonate as a difference from what you guys do with removed its vastly different clearly,0.736,0.136,0.025,0.839
high,lost,about company,client so you know removed for us is weve got all these people that are you know average is probably  years old working on the players on mainframes and they wannaknow they wanna have that daily report its its always the same report that they get right industry issues client not obviously not the same data but the same report they want to know how many pendant removed of claims are sitting in these cues daily et cetera you know and sothey you is knows as you know more of a dashboarding reporting tool and i think it sends them reports to emails and stuff like this this pdf industry issues ends client again you know average ages probably pretty high so theyre stealing last century this to me is a different use case i guess its more internal well maybe that i see what you were saying earlier like this is more of a hey change your the way yourethinking about this instead of asking for your pdf report go and dig into the data and just be very proactive more you know interact with your data a little more i guess yeah problem is you dont work for one were not going to change that will work for hey how are used to going from meeting every morning at nine  and they just show the same thing and theyve been doing that for  years im trying to think of the so one of the things were trying to do as a company is move from you know client has been a plumbing company for a long time we were moving transactions between all hospitals and payers and back and forth about company client and in past couple of years weve been transitioning to being more of a data company and one of the gap thats miss that thats you know im starting to see is ifi want to democratize the data inside the company i want anyone to be able to say you know what let me go dig in some of this data i dont really have a good tool for that industry issues sales engineer yeah so one thing is the big picture that kind have this is an example of a dashboard these are all answers from search like i just did we cant do thatdashboard and we can do the report generation schedule all that its not going to be with all the bells and whistles that removed has right industry issues ends sales engineer youre going to be doing the basic stuff and arts are going to be pretty basic charts but we have those functionality but thats not why i see you just wanted to but ifyou needed to say hey you got that we got that as far as data democratization kind of the idea of like seeing whats out there search types sales engineer so one of the things we do have is lets say we just wanted a user who is kind have theyre not the data engineer theyre not the data is data analyst the regularbusiness user would they kinda want to explore that whats out there we have the ability what we call search on answers and this is searching the work of basically other people what objects created and i could ask a question like no what are my top suppliers oops this quarter and what this is gonna do is do a like a third party vendor search the search you saw before when against the data and has to return the correct answer from the datasales engineerthis is like a third party vendor search on objects created kind of seen what content is out there which is why you see a list of content right so its kind of matching the search so this gives you the ability for a user to say okay i can see theres this that this pin board what about supplier data drill down sales engineer hey this is kind of interesting i know that i was looking to suppliers but i might want to look at this quarter to quarter by store region and it gives users the opportunity to pop in interact with something a set of data that that might be interesting with them i ended up choosing from this kind of dole theyre just a little kpibye byethey,0.9984,0.146,0.022,0.831
high,lost,demo,sales engineer pinboard can kinda come in into the search experience thats being used and start exploring that from oops sorry but what youre describing sounds more like hey as a user what i wanna do is let me go to this data tab here ive got data and ill let me show you what we have data in data architecture sales engineerwell here we go weve got data in our third party vendor or third party vendor or big query wherever it is maybe we are using some data virtualization tools to connect to the supplier to connect to the service now and i want to explore that so we can create connections and ill show you i have a connection here already created just so i can show that quickly so i have a connection here a couple of to third party vendor but if i were to edit this a user can simply make a connection to their data source and this is more of that data engineer person and when they have that connection based off of there that connection privileges theyll see this is no im sorrysales engineeryes no if like they can expand this lets just look at it lets say i wanted to look at some of this healthcare data and they wanted to explore this a couple of these this patient info and this claim data they can select that and start exploring that data right away industry issues sales engineerso this again is not necessarily a business user this is more a data engineer business analyst whos comfortable working with data that they would connect to themselves and they could actually start exploring this tables and searching it right away so we have that in a persona for the business analyst the data engineer as well as that in business user which tends to have you know bigger group of users but we can fit that type of profile again data architecture sales engineeri think like in your case it has to be a strong use case that was strongly attached to company when you compare to what you already have and a preexisting experience with company but youll see here i just started that was that wouldnt have a ton of data but the claim data you can see ive already got kind have a ive got the met a data search types sales engineerso i can start searching just that data i connected to right away i didnt even move the data i just connected to it but i can start searching that data if i wanted to and asking questions ofclientyeah i mean i get the general idea when when you do the third party vendor type search and youre finding things i guess these things that others have created or by they suggested queries or what other pinboard sales engineerthere so they are things others have created so you see that right i must have saved that last year was five minutes ago so this was the i created this pin boards so what happens is lets just step into this very quickly and well just do that sales data drill down sales engineerlets say i wanted to see the gross profit percentage state versus state and i wanted to see that for well just say bourbon and lets say i wanna see ill see what that overall is i get that percentage but i want to see the comparison lets say i want to see that month i have the comparison but i wont say monthly this year so i get this answer right from company by asking that question looking at these two things let me put them on the same scale maybe i should it shows a better product here but then bourbon just looking at everything just bourbon pinboard sales engineerso i get this answer here and if i want to save this answer i can either save it as its one off answer or create what we call pin boards so pin board is like a dashboard except its going to be kind of this thing that users could explore and interact with data drill down sales engineerlet me create a pin board here no its called a sales engineer okay and so i create this and maybe my next question is hey in state versus state maybe i wanna look at by category and lets see what comes up here gonna compare im looking at this comparison between these two states actually lets see what it is versus the rest of all the states will add that in there too pinboard sales engineerand i get an answer here and looking at this comparison i want to capture this i can preview this up of course if i want to add labels all that kind of stuff ill just pin this and i could go on to keep asking my own questions right and so when i capture these bigger in a pin board so this is an object and it has the answers that ive pinned to it right and i can of course just make this however i want the with the layout here but as an object now its got my answers pinboard ends sales engineeri share it with others either other users or groups i belong to and now somebody could search on things and if they search like theyre like hey i wanna see im interested in gross profit in state this would be a possible match to the search that you saw before right pinboard sales engineerthe other thing about this this pin board here when i share it with others we have this ability to explore it and what the explorer gives users the ability to do is they can drill down directly from here and remember they can drill wherever they want they dont need to drill to their own selection to what somebody else is selected they can go wherever they want and they can use either make their changes to the pin board by adding and replacing things that are in this chart or you suggestions based off of what other users for example people that have used this retail sales have a tendency to look at the bakery department,0.9989,0.14,0.029,0.831
high,lost,company product,sales engineerso maybe i want to choose the bakery department and see what that is by using looking at tendencies of others so a lot of what company is is that idea of just free form exploration of search and then theres machine learning that were just kinda talking to that where its based off of what other people are doing on the same data that youre working with and what theyre doing and so company learns and and gives you the option to select from those tendencies or search for those answers we have another piece called company product which is basically some algorithms that will base and search thatll give you answers that it finds and says hey are these interesting to you search types sales engineerand thats another thing we can search we can show but really the thing for us is you gotta get across that your users if they want to get their answers right away a search bar is what theyre familiar with and they can get their answers without knowing the data language by just typing in their business terms,0.6187,0.043,0.0,0.957
high,lost,company product, use cases clientokay i think i get it i think im just really not like it is not something that we would put i think side by side with removed any sort of like one two one battle youd lose basically because its not the right use case for itsales engineerand on the use case so you know like for example i can tell you some of our customers here in city removed there removed customer before we came in they still use my perception but they needed to ask questions about their different markets there penetration on their markets based off of the different services they offersales engineerso for their marketing analysis to get in there and get those answers they can either get a removed dashboard that pops up and has kind of that load of data for that day or they can come into a search bar ask a custom question about different things about the area theyre searching in and get those answers about homes pass penetration and then take action on that use cases sales engineerand they do that with spot right removed uses us to keep up to monitor your supply chain i mean she plays not only is it you know something that you know how busy removed as you drive by one you gotta make sure that theres not traffic out in the street right and so you can see how important it is for them to monitor your supply chain keep up with that and make sure that theyve got the right products in stock every one of the stores and of course every one of those stores is almost individually operated and so theres a a very big onus on that and company use cases ends sales engineerthe way they choose to do that they also have third party vendor there but they use company for that particular use caseclientyeah i think i get i can place it in there so for me the challenge is going to be then like it sounds like its more of a quick side by use case where again at least where for what i can picture right now is wed be more internal more sort of like business maybe executives trying to make sense of the data maybe trying to drive decisions from thereclienti just by nature im gonna favor quick site as as you know the first go to place its you know its just hot but you know account executive can tell you that im going to function is just basically im gonna try whats there it feels the need then im good to gosales engineerquick side a product that you already have because of a relationshipclientno well i mean we do we do you know just because where removed customer and you know were basically looking at that as my default go to placeyes gotchasales engineerclientjust a default stance i guess that i think that is the kind of use case because with quick site i was thinking of that specific use case,0.8648,0.05,0.035,0.916

high,won,about company,client  and end of last year of course we started was the end of last year there there are some good use cases im with company yeah what they did was they took all of our visualization platforms recently and theyve got me involved on all of them now and then enterprise data not just care data so a bit of an expansion for me  about company ends  account executive  congratulations client thats great to hear man to start us off just since you brought it up i was hoping one of the prepare questions i had for you is later on today we have a call with her view where were going to be talking through just what what the focus areas are because tom has asked us to get domain enablement for client were connecting with harbor here today to validate his priorities and how those two things connect one of the items that will be discussing today is kind of current use cases that are live with company and one of the areas that was indicated to us thats live is the customer care use case with company could you tell us a little bit about it please client  sure i wouldnt call it that live i dont know anyone from customer care of that used account executive  you might say that didnt know client  so and and i think the the reason for that is that they so like a name has been our key care champion within that organization and his comment was hey look if if we have a team that can make us dashboards why would we also dig around like why wouldnt we just ask you all to make us something that we can continue to use from their forward because i think theremovedpage  of  removed   pm the thing that we hi reevaluate is the in company  use cases  client  what the use case theyve got is very well covered by other material it doesnt even act to supplement that material very well and in in the customer care realm theyve got a lot of employees that they really dont want them spending their day jacking around the data they theyve got a a job to do with handling customer service  use cases ends  client  they dont really want them exploring and company so that audience may not be at least certainly not the way we try to we need to change but that audience in particular may not be an ideal one to have tried to start with  about company  account executive  interesting i appreciate that just reacting to that would it be worth having a conversation with name and educating him a little bit on the differences between how our customers that have similar use cases use company versus third party vendor and third party vendor because i can tell you the four people from the company side of this phone call found that come in very interesting because its we dont see us at solving the same problem is third party vendor  about company ends  account executive  and so when our customers tell us that it typically indicates to us that that customer hasnt had an opportunity to understand the use case and and kind of the unique differentiated value that company provides i mean i think we would agree with connor if hes like hey this is really well covered with dashboards why are we using company we would have the same questionclient removedpage  of  removed   pm  yeah and i would i do think corners and an excellent person but hes not going to be with blue much longer account executive  now client  yeah which is a bummer because hes one of my favorite people to work with but yeah we should if were going to do something for care think about what would what would be a better use case for them  customer base  account executive  whats connors role client  connors role is let me see if the time it was like overall strategic changing for customer care so something like that so hes got the he had automation team that setting up robots to go through and take action when we see see certain events that hes got the robotics team that would initiate it responds without people first but then also got an analysis team that would really dive deep  customer base ends  client  that team actually would probably be our our go to any absences corner to figure out and when youre when youre doing the doing that analysis how can we enable it better account executive  you know do you have contacts over there or is this a license time kinda situation client  i would tend to talk with with bird i has see me nowremovedpage  of  removed   pm account executive  can you give me that name one more time please im just taking notes client  yeah we are dropping in chat here account executive  awesome thanks name  wrapup ends  client  i wanna make sure i spell her name correctly systems engineer  yeah account executive  problem please take a look client  so simple when i was typing it account executive  awesome thank you for that thats a big help client  to that some of the feedback that ive gotten from the care folks were like hey ive ive also got this feature if i start to like ask third party vendor or pull a data set into ask third party vendor so why wouldnt i use that instead of company and and i dont know the good answer to that either to be able to know what i would be targeting with my team when were using companyremovedpage  of  removed   pm  yeah i mean  im here  to help out with that as well account executive systems engineer client account executive  yeah i mean on that front client just i encourage you to be really transparent this isnt a pop quiz you know theyll theres no better answer to the named the truth whats your view on the role of company for your team and and your role do you see a place where it fits in and it definitely makes sense or do you feel that its kind have redundant client  so i do think there are some redundancy issues in the stack overall as so starting way up and with our enterprise data warehouse where third party vendor itself has a lot of features where we can democratize normalizing democratize data and then yeah between between third party vendor in third party vendor theres a very large overlap where its hard to reconcile like why are we still heavily invested in both what i what i wanted to do there is and and what would be of great interest to me frankly is i can do a lot at the database layer to create something that functions like a semantic layer without needing to introduce something like an actual semantic layer an additional tool as a semantic layer right and if i whatever i do it the database then whatever whoever walks into our viewers office next with something to sell if if they buy a new presentation layer i got you know what im kind of okay with it because ive got my key information is in the database now bye if ive got functionality where i can still use the other presentation tools they get bought to use my semantic layer and then i can allow people like hey okay if you love home tally visualization whatever it comes out in three years right that will be the new hot thing if you love that you can just attach it to our semantic layer is still and youll get all the same numbers as us as opposed to being forced to go right into a very specific tool that becomes kind of interesting to me from where i sit in the company where it looks to me like what your strategy is to have a lot of tools agenda  removedpage  of  removed   pm  i think thats fair  helpful or not but account executive client account executive  yeah it is yeah thats very helpful i appreciate you being i honestly like just so transparent with us this is hugely helpful i i do think that it would be worth taking  minutes just like were planning on was part of asking me to take another  minutes with you and just walk you through like hey heres what was proved out on the proof of value and why  about company  account executive  and then id be curious on your feedback on hey heres max where i think this fits in to what were trying to achieve because again we dont see ourselves you know how this is youve heard this before but we dont see ourselves as competitors to products like third party vendor and third party vendor like in our view the company view of the world those two products are very redundant i would agree with you i dont know why you have both but all of our if you look at a slide of you know the nascar logos slide of company customers all  are incredibly mature third party vendor and third party vendor customers and we have customers like the city so on and gone all that sits on the hes the chief data officer he sits on third party vendor customer advisory board and they spend seven figures with company so that the rational question is why and its because we solve different problems  about company ends  account executive  so csm and i will be happy to educate you on that help share a couple of use cases that you know we think makes a lotta sense and then also feedback information that we learned from harbor year and from name as far as that goes priorities are concerned so that we can be hit the hip todays call we set up because csm and company employee who are on the call here are part of our customer success organization and so what weve been asked to do by name and behavior and by everybody that invested in company is to help well kind of get there i back on the ball and relaunch company so part of that is in order to get where youreremovedpage  of  removed   pm going you have to find out where you are and so having conversations like this where im saying hey i have people out of you know have your team telling me that customer care is a live company use case is that true but its also measuring just kind have oneonone level metrics like what is lose consumption of company today how many searches who are the power users and weve been exchanging emails with being over the last few weeks to try to get that get that number so the two things we were hoping to talk about today specifically and ill transfer or transition kind of the focus away from me and onto my customer success colleagues one is company employee has been involved with with since day one and im brought to our attention that he has access through vpn is no longer working and then so we wanted to try to solve that if we could and then number two would be actually pushing the commands to enable that consumption measurement so that you or me or both can provide us with updates on heres how much company weve used and thats important because you guys have a renewal at the end of february and so were working with time to figure out do you have the correct amount do you need more do you have not enough give too much until we get a baseline metrics that we can agree on its very hard to answer those kinds of questions and have a commercial discussion so ill transition again to automate company employee let them talk for a couple of minutes about those two items but thats what we were hoping to get done in todays call client  cool company employee  actually i think you said you kind of spec that out max theres a lot that we want to learn that i used to have access directly on the environment i go through the vm ware horizon client logged in with my six eight character number could get in but i think probably just overlaps with time maybe my password has been reset so and maybe this is something like either take it with you remain to kinda just get rid of that reactivated because i think that allowed me to see what what objects people are using it company who are the active users gives us a launch pad to go ask those additional questions as well as look at as macro saying what the consumption is so that we can true up or adjust the the needle for where the agreement my line up next time client  yeah i can i can help with thatclient removedpage  of  removed   pm  im not sure how quick it will help company employee  well it doesnt need to be like next day or two but getting access would be good client  yeah what can use can you send me what your your number is company employee  yeah i actually there its in the chat chat yeah i had to use five oc to verify so that thats still i can get the often number obviously but thats where you still let me in but it does not theres no longer client  okay ill see if i can initiate some some kind of password reset or right something to get you back in on the virtual machine client  and then i my company employee  ill share my screen just so i can get this far so just so youre aware so like i can get past the off too long on and then this is the second prompt and heres where my password they used to work no longer works and this is you have to get into the virtual machine client  okay client  cool client  and i my impression has been shy mall can getremovedpage  of  removed   pm  to csm client  some of the consumption management maybe maybe thats different than what youre talking about too company employee  small on your end client  yeah company employee  okay yeah yeah most likely yes but not on our end thats what were looking to client  right okay csm  and then hey i think would this be a proper time to let pol know what those commands are to enable consumption pricing systems engineer  i think well in the back end access so that most likely its gonna be a cookie but hes still want to have back end access hell be online in in that theyre  hours csm  okay so thats first to generate the removed file and systems engineer  enabled itremovedpage  of  removed   pm csm  yep okay perfect so client i know youve been on that email thread with us kind of speaking with me as well in terms of sending instructions to enable to consumption pricing were just working with one of our engineers hes in country so he will be online probably i think connect cool well yeah a couple of hours i guess a few hours yeah a little bit but what youll have to do is generate a removed file and from there hey can share with us how you guys can enable enable that on your cluster via command  data transfer  csm  is it like a typically command okay okay is that correct they physically command that they can do systems engineer  yes thats they can do csm  perfect okay so thats kind of the steps that needs to take place client just before we enable and show you how to enable that consumption pricing and then pay from there youd be able to provide further instruction correct in terms of which which data or information we may need ,0.9999,0.18,0.032,0.788
high,won,onboarding,systems engineer  yeah well i have all the information you just need to have somebody to generate that removed file csm  okay perfect okay well i think then and max is fair and ill just to i think so so when he gets on tomorrow i guess its our night it should be ready for us hopefully to go with the removed file and client will reach out with the further commandment instructions onboarding process ends  removedpage  of  removed   pm account executive  okay okay terrific so client will have some actions for you well get those command center will just send them directly to you a couple of questions before i let you go if you dont mind one is we had worked with surgeon in the past on a handful of use cases as well i know name just title is also ai and analytics do you interface with her very much or can you help me understand the difference between your roles client  yeah no its a very good question so yeah she and i do interface a lot together her focus is much more on ai and machine learning then mine which is as much more descriptive dashboards as opposed to predictive or any kind of statistical analysis account executive  very good client  generally doing her teams working mostly on stuff that an executive or at a higher kind of predictive level then tactical dashboard in that my teams doing account executive  understood thank you thats helpful and then last question is is your calendar handy like i said itll be great to get  minutes to walk you through kind of our view of the world and our partnership with were to see if there are places that we can help you you know candidly ill be the first to say if if a the use cases that we identify would be redundant and theres not pain there  onboarding process  account executive  you know were not in the business of striking where the iron is a high i think theres plenty to do in terms of providing value to you,0.9939,0.175,0.02,0.805

high,won,about company, about company  client  or what happened here or or or the next level question is okay great this happened but should we be doing that kind have and its a very very in a in a in a third party vendor word and to be fair to third party vendor we are on a very old version of third party vendor youre not on the latest version  about company ends  client  we are trying to get a third party vendor online here soon by sometime next quarter so we dont have features like explained data and ask data right now available to us so its its more about very modularized here are the questions that we need here are the areas we need to measure and here are the dashboards that measure that so thats the current state client you want to go for what finance finance is not client  yeah ill ill assets yeah specifically finance because we we leverage third party vendor right now really in tandem with our business partners and you know similar to us and he said its all about you know the the speed it takes for us to make a business decision right now data management  functions  removed    removed client  theres a lot of human intervention of no unpacking the data removing a lot of like one off its like we cant look at this data this way because abc happens that makes that dotcom so theres like manual cleaning and processes and background needs to be had  industry issues  client  an additional thing additional thing is we lack basic alerting so when a metric go south unless someones looking at that dashboard every single day were not gonna know and often its a huge investigative process to take to you know why you know our bookings are slower than usual and its like looking at  different third party vendor dashboards to figure out what kpi went wrong account executive  got it client  okay client  where do you want the time perfect you get on mute no client  i think i know i think you actually propose that youve used it pretty well so nothing from my side account executive  and client would you say is manual and speed insights can be slow what kind have time are we talking about here too you know if theres a question from the business to return and answer based on data client  probably at least at least the week and thats thats if the information is something that we have and it can be two two three weeks or even longer if its you know we need to coordinate with bi and other teams to do like a unique data pool because we dont have the infrastructure for whatever reason for that specific audit industry issues ends  client removed    removed  if its already something thats a decent its probably days and weeks if its new or like like add something more and or running in this this more contacts than its like weeks a month i think thats fair account executive  okay got it and what so then what happens what does the team do while they way  agenda  client  cross our fingers put more marketing removed to offset account executive  got it okay im sure im sure we could spend the full  minutes talking about this and you know at some point in time we can schedule time to specifically focus on that but this is a great start from my perspective sales engineer any questions before we jump into it  agenda ends  sales engineer  yeah just one question in terms of the org structure client you mentioned youre focused on finance for example is it a kind have have been spoke model we have a central bi account executive  team and then sales engineer  analyst for each department or the account executive  was kind of embedded within the business what does that look like client  hello client  its its both so we have some central analysts and we have are listed in the the extended team just bad so the common enterprise kpis and all our managedremoved    removed from within the central be already but like the marketing team has an example can put it on on top of that and and take it to the wrong direction and social token the finance team,0.9922,0.122,0.071,0.807
high,won,company product,sales engineer  gotcha and then from a data perspective is third party vendor managed all central eight or each of those groups have their own client  hello this is a central team that manages okay brilliant im its automatic account executive  got it perfect cool and all of your data and stuff like that client  it is not all of it is we are in the process of migrating from sql server to third party vendor  agenda  client  so i think by the time by the time touch part comes in for all practical purposes will be going again third party vendor on account executive  sounds great alright well lets jump into it then i have any have you seen company before are you familiar with us at all client  lets assume folks im not seeing it although i havent like a couple of years ago so client  okay ill send like a youtube video or something but not really account executive  okay sounds good ill provide a quick overview so well go through a couple of slides and then well kick it over to sales engineer and well well show you guys a demo will show you how we connect to third party vendor and then the user experience as wellremoved    removed  search types  account executive  and then perhaps schedule some more time to go into more detail as needed so from a company perspective founded in removed our founders were focused on bringing search to enterprise data so if you think about we have a question in your personal life to go to third party vendor you go to third party vendor you search you get the answer back right away company wanted to deliver that for enterprise data and so we combined search technology with ai driven insights and and sales engineer can show you a little bit more around that essentially what were providing there is elevating keyword so as you as your finance team starts you company your finance users are going to be are going to get suggestions as they search that are things that have been searched by other finance users or by yourself in the past and so this is common to like if you go to third party vendor and you frequently by something is going to suggest that when you start to search theres also an insights engine or an analytics engine where you know if theres a peak or something like that that you wanted to dig into more and and find the underlying cause,0.9941,0.146,0.013,0.84
high,won,about company,account executive  we can run thousands of queries on the back end and elevate what we think is is driving that anomaly and that we can show you what that looks like as well so search and ai insights and let us to some of the large you know customers in the world removed huge company customer  about company  account executive  but one more its also a massive third party vendor summer so we absolutely work can work in unison in many cases we can talk a little bit more about that as we go removed company employee removed merchandisers that are using company non technical people that are helping to determine how to price based on region you know whether to mark things up marketings down et cetera and then lastly technology customers have led us to the leader portion of the magic quadrant and were the first there and six years and the fastest to get there any questions on this part here nope cool so what you guys are doing now moving your data from sequel to third party vendor has essentially you know represents the modernization of data management  data architecture  account executive  however what were finding is that its still challenging to get insights out that data so many of our customers despite having made the move to third party vendor or you know name your cdw still have a challenge really capitalizing on that investmentremoved    removed and getting insights out of that data and thats because the traditional dashboard pipeline can be complex and slow,0.946,0.08,0.009,0.911
high,won,about company,account executive  so client you mentioned it can take you know a week optimistically sometimes to to three or a month depending on how unique it is when a request comes in from lets say finance you go to the central bi team they may have to aggregate a cube the data create that subset data name whatever it may be created dashboard send it to finance but then as you mentioned if you have to drill down and get into you have another question or subsequent questions you may have to go back to the bi team and start over does this does this does this resonate as this client  yeah i think youre preaching to the choir here lets keep moving  search types  account executive  okay sounds good perfect so then im gonna jump ahead here this is our this is our vision from a company perspective switch from dashboards to being able to search your data and get it didnt get insights immediately and so we think about what makes that possible user experience its all about speed insights so are are indexing rate and ranking engine were constantly indexing all of the data its a its a full value index yeah client  so do we actually arrive natural language questions or do you right but youre writing there the name of the metrics and the dimensions,0.9814,0.127,0.0,0.873
high,won,demo,account executive  can you wanna take down sales engineer  yeah its a bit of both and it might make sense once i get into the demo sunday ill show you where client  okay well i just wanted to find out yeah go aheadremoved    removed account executive  i i think lets go and jump into the demo awesome yeah client  yes lets do that because i i think i think we all get a gist of what the tool in the in the platform and what the tool can do i think we want to look at the demo and see and ask questions that are in appreciate that flexibility oddly enough  agenda ends  account executive  yeah no so sales engineer  youre saying you dont want my  slides send an client  hey ive been in a demo where i said you know the sales guy goes last if we have time the sales guy goes goes down otherwise its all about the product sales engineer  five in can you see my client  okay yeah sales engineer  hello so im just gonna use generic sales data its really more about the workflow and the experience then the actual data that im showing here today but think of me as one of your end users so im probably a viewer in third party vendor im someone who receives dashboards and that may serve  percent of my needs and great were not trying to solve for another dashboard thats not will need the problem arises for those users when they have the new questions you guys know they have to submit a request they have to talk to an analyst and thats one that days to a week turnaround time comes into play so lets say i have just a high level question about what are my top stores,0.965,0.119,0.029,0.852
high,won,demo,client removed    removed  quick question is it if i if i think about it and lets assume the whole idea of movies behind this so this does not have to be any subject area wise thing categorization or you can go against everything at the same time sales engineer  so theres a concept of worksheets in company which are semantic models so were not saying point just generic connection to third party vendor its everything but its focused on specific subject area  data management  functions ends  client  based on top for company to kind of process to inform me sales engineer  yeah its easy its a nameer of minutes to connect to third party vendor and build one but there is that worksheet which is name client  thank thank you yeah so each of these are then those quote unquote modern stand right  pinboard  sales engineer  so account executive  we see here sales engineer  these are actually pieces of content that have already been created in company so these are saved searches these are dashboards this is the common thing when someone comes to the bi text say hey we have a removed dashboards good luck finding your kpi and you have to kind of sift through  data drill down  sales engineer  so instead were going to say hey what are my top storage just search like you would on third party vendor and then its looking at across all of that content and all of the models that are in company saying hey someones already asked that questionremoved    removed and its within the context of a dashboard here where i found this dashboard on sales performance found a specific chart that answered the question of what are my top  stores and its jumping us right into the context and then if you think about a traditional dashboard and third party vendor you might have  filters that are saying hey here are the predefine hi is that you can slice and dice this dashboard by step on the right nothing is prebuilt so this is company looking at the actual searches that people are doing on this data and then offering those things out of suggestions  company product  sales engineer  so what that means in this example is a lot of people are asking about state specifically so company surface that as kind of like a trending topic if you will and then we can just click on it filter or we could always type in our own thing  company product ends  sales engineer  here again this goes to anything in the data and we can really go in any direction this is really just the jumping off point that were had initial question company found an answer that someone has already created and then i can augmented or alter it however i see fit the flip,0.9963,0.132,0.0,0.868
high,won,demo,sales engineer  it is hey i want to search direct against third party vendor there wasnt already a dashboard and company that was created and instead here i want to just ask new questions so i wanna say what was monthly sales by region you see as im typing in here company making the suggestion  data drill down ends  sales engineer  so theres this whole search index thats built on top of the data thats in third party vendor so as i type things in its not just columns in the data but its actually all of the value so someone could search for a specific product or sku or and client world of specific customer or survey question,0.7906,0.102,0.0,0.898
high,won,demo,sales engineer removed    removed  its the full value index and it guides the user and surfaces thing for the top the more things are you so its kind of a similar guided experience to if youre searching on third party vendor or third party vendor or something like that sales engineer  questions so far thats feedback client  pretty powerful so youre saying you can search for values within the within the attribute them so its not just the attribute  search types ends  sales engineer  yeah exactly is there and there was also sorry go ahead client  yeah is there alert because like one of the issues is like lets just say bookings like are the revenue they bring in as draft unexpectedly over the last few weeks is there any functionality is to give you that traffic,0.9828,0.222,0.008,0.77
high,won,company product,client  all these kpis are you know at a higher variance then we usually see versus me having to query like  different things to manually check yeah what does that look right sales engineer  yeah theres a theres a couple of pieces there so one yes there a standard alerting store i could say hey i want to save this as a i want to save it to my new pin board here just call it a client pin board and i could save that and then i could schedule it and create an alert that says hey when sales drops below x send me this pin board so instead of receiving it just every day and then naturally just stop kinda looking at it it would only send based on that threshold thats thats another piece where a bit of the intelligence comes into play where if i say hey im curious about the change between november and december it looks like sales went down  k or so company product  sales engineer removed    removed  then we could say hey do some analysis for me here and company is going to automatically go through look at all of the factors that could have caused this change and figure out where that significance or the most significant change happened what that means is that you can get that result and you can also schedule and say hey look at this month compared to last month show me the factors and then when something is significant then it would present a result like this where it says hey  of your  products had the biggest drop and thats what contributed to that change  company product ends  sales engineer  so i know i answered and kind have multiple ways there but does that hit on some of the stuff were looking at client client  yeah i mean i really loved the concept just definitely curious client  whats the timing on this part i use it all like for your time like youre saying and obviously this is a demo environment but in like in a in a normal practical he didnt know how much time or does it have to keep running on the background  company product  client  what what happens tell me a little bit more sales engineer  like how much time does it take to return a result like account executive  yeah client  so if if somebody has not analyze that data said before is is are these things already being better than on the background in the anticipation of questions are they very then when you click like go to company product sales engineer  yeah so for for what i just did thats an explicit user action so its saying someone saying hey i want company to do a bunch of analysis hereremoved    removed,0.9964,0.166,0.006,0.828
high,won,demo,sales engineer  and so that is a nameer of seconds  minutes just depending on how much low third party vendor instance can handle on the warehouse that size appropriately so the results come in seconds two minutes and then it can be scheduled client  yeah yeah thats the stand thats the part i was looking for thank you  data drill down  sales engineer  yeah so just to keep going here in the sake of time lets say theres this high point here in august and i want to drill down again the whole theme is nothing is free architected theres no like dashboard extra and our hierarchy or drill down path thats predefine and so for a user they can drill in any direction to any level of granularity within that worksheet or semantic layer thats been created so i could say i want to jolt product type drill down to the product level within jackets then i want to just say show me my top five maybe i want to change the context and say hey i dont care about the specific month and i just wanna look across all time here,0.8257,0.117,0.048,0.835
high,won,demo,sales engineer  really the whole point is im starting with that ad hock high level question and then just iterating and searching and drilling down wherever i want to get so i can get to something granular then i could say hey in the finance world maybe hey i found this one line item that cost blew out of proportion and we want to take action on it but its going from high level to something you can then find to take action on  use cases ends  client  so what im not seeing a lot of these trust i guess its just like year over year context our business is super seasonal so is that just like very easy to add or do you guys only just do like looking at one time like one dimension attributes sales engineer  thats true,0.9862,0.209,0.0,0.791
high,won,demo,removed    removed sales engineer  theres a couple of ways that you can do stuff like that within company we could say hey and i think the status that might only be a year so ill do quarter over quarter instead but i could say hey show me this quarter first last quarter and then i could say hey this quarter is not all the way complete heard last course thats not fair so say hey at quarter to date and then we could say look at its based on the day of the quarter and so im just kinda doing these add hawk just depending on the question right but then you can even take it further step and say hey i want create a cohort of my customers and say actually only want my top five products that sold,0.4115,0.068,0.034,0.898
high,won,company product,sales engineer  i just want the top five based on q of last years sales and i just created a pretty advanced piece of analysis there were behind the scenes and i know im preaching to the choir behind the scenes thats pretty complex sequel and thats not a trivial think though even third party vendor thats not a trivial thing to create this cohort of customers but its kind have masking that simplicity just in in search here or mountain on the complexity excuse me  data management  functions ends  client  theres still feels a little complicated if i all i want us like a year over year like line right and you know i its really hard for me to expect like my business partners to be able to know how to do this sales engineer  yeah and i mean theres theres multiple ways to do the same thing  data drill down  sales engineer  so it could say show me the growth of sales monthly and then you can add year over year so were not saying that company from z with zero training people are going to be able to ask questions like this but compare it to any other tool out there and  data drill down ends  client   minute training for a newsremoved    removed sales engineer  and get them asking pretty powerful questions client  but i guess the last thing is like how easy it can i make a chart that shows both yeah like you know year over year growth as well as my absolute number this years bookings like thats a very simple thing that we look at every single day sales engineer  say it again just this years bookings client  you every year sales engineer  so sales this year and you you would want last year and then you just want the percentage to client  i love the percentage and also the asset values sales engineer  yeah so youd want eight point six nine divided by last years yeah yeah so thats a setting we can its just not turned on on this cluster you can have it so by default just shows that its just not turned on in this demo instance but thats something where you can have a third column that just automatically generated there based on what i just did client  can the users create that on their own so like the simple math he might be he might just be a plus b sales engineer  yeah we can always add a formula here and then just say sales this year divided by sales last year sales engineer  and now we have that sorry my air pods justaccount executive removed    removed  died account executive  so you guys well city is getting his air pods back on what what other questions you guys have client  i think you know if you dont mind going to the range of the products like youve entered at the two main areas are are they it so standard pin boards or dashboard which are which are legalese legacy asked that have been converted into dashboards i guess and then there is the greenfield have all the access to all the data to be able to to find in any new items and also on the on the you know like is there like a like a english translation to the to the numbers that comes in meaning you showed the other top five things but some tools to actually do that they actually create like a blurb that says you can take this blog and put it in a powerpoint as an example with the with the visualization directly versus having to rewrite that on that on your own sales engineer  natural language generation type thing client  exactly sales engineer  yeah company doesnt have that i know like third party vendor has third party partners that ive extensions in practicality and this is me speaking from both company and third party vendor experience those tools are really used to great value its oftentimes kinda generic just hey this is top five by excel not built in some that could be on the road map but not a huge focus area on the natural language generation front client  definitely send some assets the company product soon sales engineer  sorry say that client  again could you please so some aspects of company product toosales engineer removed    removed  show spike im sorry i cant hear,0.9994,0.214,0.016,0.77
high,won,company product,client  hello company product i think youve been wants to see if there are any more details on company product sales engineer  gotcha gotcha client  anything that you have regarding forecasting or any data science sales engineer  yeah so i did one example of looking at the change from november to december we can also just say hey i have a search here and i want to run company product against this entire set of data ill kick it off and what its doing behind the scenes is then running outlier detection looking for correlations looking for trends so theres a variety of statistical functions that its running behind the scenes and for those that are more statistics thing fine you can do things like change the p value choose exactly what its doing and then what it results in is something like this where similar we saw before on the change analysis in this case just looking across a wider swath of questions and while this is loading to the forecasting front forecasting is it something that is available out of the box with company product so oftentimes customers use other more data science focus tools like a data robot or data queue or something to run their models there put it in third party vendor and and use company as the visualization layer on top of it so similar to what we saw before saying hey for the store theres a skew with higher quantity and everything else or as i scroll to the bottom here its surfacing hey for this particular store things are trending up and then we can give that feedback so the more to use the more feedback tickets the more valuable these things become over time and now were getting close to the top of the hour account executive anything you know  data architecture  account executive  i was going to ask as you need do you does your team also manage third party vendor or is there a different group that that will definitely client  group that manages third party vendor environmentaccount executive removed    removed  got it so one of the logical next steps would be for us to show you how we actually connect to third party vendor that doesnt take very long that would also show you the semantic layer that sales engineer mentioned the worksheet piece so we can show you you know how easy it is to get data search ready ultimately though its super easy to connect to your third party vendor instance and test it out on your own data  data architecture ends  account executive  and that is what we would suggest you know long term short term but as a as the kind of way to evaluate company client  right and how does that how does i mean i think youre alluding to the how is that how the p a b or c model works,0.9663,0.073,0.004,0.923

high,won,about company,account executive fantastic so client client are you guys familiar with company at allclient name ive met with name and he gave me some highlights of it but yeah thats thats thats the only exposure i betclient  yeah and i am not familiar with itaccount executive okay sounds great well well provide a quick overview and then well jump into a demo so you can see company an action i think at a high level name maybe could would you mind just starting by kicking off why you thought that revenue cycles would potentially be a good fit and then we can jump into the overview and democlient sure i mean for one reason is as were looking at company as a potential tool to kind of fill some gaps in our our portfolio tools agenda ends client we we dont really have any tools that have the ability to just do data exploration or discovery with users that dont have a lot of technical background or coating skills you know our sequel or being able to connected directly to data sources on their own data management  functions client and so this was a tool that we could stand up with our existing data models or whether were talking about synergy or you know finance or revenue data that are being built and we could bring them into a space where you dont have to have sequel to get into the dataremoved   removed data drill down client and you know take a hunch that you have and and drill down further and then once you get to a point to where you have the information you need you can add another data elements and we thought it was really flexible in a very easy way to get into information data architecture client and it leverage is a lot of the capabilities of third party vendor and other tools that we have in our portfolio from a data back end perspective poor performance and for ease of use and connectivity and stuff so we thought would be something to take a look at removed billing data architecture ends client whats a good case because theres so much data from a transaction level that would be nice to be able to explore when were moving to third party vendor and were moving away from you know tools like third party vendor and universities and and weve already moved off of on a we just thought that you know third party vendor doesnt quite have that capabilities that company has and so we wanted to take a look at it as another tool to fill in any gaps in our overall selfservice data exploration portfolio that was the main reason why we wanted to look at removed billingaccount executive thanks name so client client as we go through this please jump in and ask questions and then we can talk about next steps and timelines and whatnot that weve been working with name team and our team on as we go forward about company account executive sound good yep perfect can everybody see my screen by the way alright fantastic so company we recently celebrated our ninth anniversary and so and then our founders came from third party vendor and when they came over and started company at the time there are a lot of bi tools available search types account executiveremoved   removed you guys at third party vendor in third party vendor those were around i think click was around but it was all really dashboarding centric and our founders coming from third party vendor with the search background experience recognize that theres no way nobodys offering the ability to search enterprise data the way you would ask a question in your personal life go to third party vendor ask the question get the answer back right away and so company brought a search bar to enterprise data we pair that with ai driven insights so as youll see in the demo over time we begin to elevate words that are most relevant for your specific and and to make that a more seamless search experience over time,0.999,0.169,0.009,0.822
high,won,about company,account executive so technology differentiators of let us do some really large customers you can see in the middle there one of the great ones we brought on a couple of quarters ago as anthem when we first tested with them we connected to removed of data and i think nine minutes and we were up in searching customer base account executive and so thats a great a new remove company that were working with sales engineer actually cover as worked with can be quite a bit in the past down in city as well and theyre using company on on stuff like to to combine a myriad of different data sources customer base ends account executive i think theyre pulling in some website data some call center data as well as some health information data to pull together a more holistic view and analyze that and thought in sales engineer could spend some more time speaking to that when we jump into the demo and then you know the technology customers theyve let us do a leadership position in the magic quadrant data architecture account executive and as name mentioned we we partner very well with third party vendor we also in fact they recently invested remove in company but they also we also partner well with removed which i know is a big partner of client we also partner with a ws and third party vendor so any cloud data warehouse company can connect to and live query and deliver search analytics any questions so faraccount executiveremoved   removed all right largely the data management market or the database the data management problem has been solved by cloud data warehouses and you guys have moved to third party vendor i think theres some snaps as well within client but you guys understand the value of getting data into an easy to manage elastic load cost cloud data warehouse about company account executive the challenge we still see is about  percent of that data goes unused for analytics so despite the investment in getting it into a place where it could or should be analyzed most of the tools today from analytics perspective cant keep up either from a volume horsepower or theres a technical gap in business users being able to use the get value out of the data industry issues account executive so this is what we typically see weve talked to name about this and i think this resonates from a general what the pipeline looks like in terms of delivering reports on the api side where a group like removed billing for example has a question your business users may have a question theyll come to your team ask the team for a report that would answer x number of questions you guys go get through data prepared to aggregate it and then build the dashboard and get it out to the users and generally speaking what we find is that answers  to  percent of the questions but then theres a follow up question like hey now can i get this and now how would i do this and can i answer this and so you end up and kinda theres infinite loop of building reports in pushing them out to the business would love to pause here and see if this is similar in revenue cycles yeah very much soclientaccount executive got it okay sounds good so from company perspective our goal is or a proposition is to really make the data team you guys his team really the keepers and curators of that data put the guardrails in place but then enable the business with the search bar so they can ask questions of that data and get answers back right away search types account executive and so rather than pushing out a dashboard that answers  percent of the questions you enable the data and give them a search bar that can answer thousandsremoved   removedof questions and well show what that looks like in practice but what weve seen across our customers is a good removed good example about company account executive they had  people using a bi tools before company and now they have over four  active company users that are using company to make data driven decisions what this looks like is essentially moving from static dashboards on the left to a more iterative search experience on the right data drill down account executive where you ask a question you get the answer in a best fit visualization on the fly and then from there you can iterate you can add another keyword you can right click and drill down into the data you can change your visualization or you can very easily save and share these visualizations to create your own workspace and dashboard,0.9986,0.132,0.004,0.864
high,won,demo,account executive so im gonna pause here and pass it over to sales engineer for the demo but let me know if you got any questions as we go looks like theres couple of in the chat never mind arts at drop okaysales engineer i will share out here in place to interrupt me as im going to ask questions i wanna make this interactive can you guys see my screen okay cool yep yep so hi im going through industry issues account executivesales engineer here think of me not as the dashboard developer but as the consumer of dashboard so im someone who has access to probably hundreds of third party vendor and or third party vendor reports today and sorry account executive point that may serve  percent of my needs but its one i have those new questionclientremoved   removed hi thissales engineer is the follow ups that were not prebuilt into a dashboard thats when i have challenges because im not cool enoughclientsales engineer i dont have the skill set or the tooling to answer those myself so i have to submit a request find an analyst and that takes time and and stay im gonna fill that gap with some what company can do so but that said i started in the dashboard of course company like any other analytics tool can create a dashboard but instead of that being the endpoint in the consumption cycle this is really just the jumping off point,0.978,0.13,0.027,0.842
high,won,demo,sales engineer and naturally thats prompts new questions and thats where im going to shift gears to search can we get asking my own question so lets say i have an initial question of what is my weekly number of payments and this is remove payment plated data here and then i could say lets break it down by claim type and youll see hi im search types account executivesales engineer typing here company making suggestions and this is where some of that intelligence that account executive alluded too comes into play company constantly looking at the actual questions that people are asking of this data and then making suggestions and its not just the columns and fields and my data but its actually every single unique value in this data data drill down sales engineer and you can see just by putting my cursor in the sorry the the search bar here company its making suggestions based on my recent searches based onremoved   removedtrending searches amongst my peers et cetera and so i could say i wanna look at the last  months for example and any,0.6757,0.043,0.008,0.95
high,won,company product,account executivesales engineer point along the way i want to save off create my own dashboard so i can share things call this meeting june  and ive just so that its in my own safe sandbox right now i havent shared it with anyone towards the end well talk about how to share collaborate but hasnt going im just saving these insights as im asking these questions and then say i want to pinboard ends account executivesales engineer drill down we see this high point here medication claims on april of this year and i want to figure out what went on there and id say drill down getting the whole theme is that theres not a predefined way i have to go meaning i could jump straight to the claim id or the patient id or in this case will jump to the primary type data drill down sales engineer and then within medical doctor i want to jump down to the actual specialties and maybe in this one i want to drill down to the actual claim level data so because company is connected to whatever the most granular version of your data is users are going to have the flexibility to go wherever they want the data down to whatever that lowest level of granularity data drill down ends sales engineer so here were at the claim level and we see the claims here im gonna add some more context and ill open this up left here this is all the data that i have access to so i could say actually just dont really care about the number of payments throughout the claim level so i want to grab the payment amounts i want to grabremoved   removedthat was covered drug and i want to grab the h group of the actual claimant so i started with a high level question saw it caught my eye drill down integrated so i got this fine grained detail data drill down sales engineer and then i could say okay show me my top  by the actual payment amount so i saw that spike i wanna see what were the top  biggest claims then i have those contextual details about that claim look and say it was all one particular drug here but pause here questions thoughtsclient no no no questions at this part related to what youre youre showing i think it i liked that as youre drilling down its out into the top two i mean i theres theres a lotta nice things where its keeping up retro breadcrumb trail of what whats been done things like that so data drill down ends client what would be the main because i see this as very similar to third party vendor now just natural language protocol or that and i think whats wont be the biggest difference heresales engineer to ask data that what youre referring to client yeah yeah have you guys use that data at allclientwait is asking about product or are you saying asking in third party vendorsales engineerthe the third party vendor feature called that state im just curious howyeah ive used itclientsales engineeryeah gotcha and was it like what were your thoughts i asked this because i was at third party vendor before coming over to company so just curious what the perception of asked data is for you guys and like how widely deployed itremoved ,0.9946,0.146,0.035,0.819
high,won,company product,client we we played around with it we you know having actually deployed it because i think right now were at a point where were trying to drive more traffic to our third party vendor dashboards and so i think adding that and have that yeah ask data by third party vendor no that the adoption we wont be there so far because were having a hard time getting adoption on the tablet dashboards and under,0.7506,0.126,0.045,0.829
high,won,about company,client and have you been leaders understand that theres a tool out there that can benefit them and you know they can already start using because i mean even as early as couple of days ago i was going over presentation on power reports on third party vendor and its something thats been out there for a while and the question is like i didnt know we have that i dont know like its a lot of i dont know industry issues client so we havent really spent the time to to expand on the tablet last day that im also because we know third party vendor is kind of gone away so thats why i wanted to kind of get an idea of what would be like the biggest struggle right i mean theres some issues that we had with us data where the question were trying to ask it wasnt as intuitive search types client you know i like the fact that this kinda learns from what other users are asking and makes sense you know make some suggestionsclient i was just curious from your end especially now yeahclientclient you told me that youre came from third party vendor what we use the biggest differenceremoved   removedsales engineer yeah i think what it comes down to is that i have yet to see a customer thats using ask data in production across a wide breadth of users it say yes you can do search in third party vendor with us data but from what ive seen what i experience there its not its not really a fullfledged tool that can be used for analytics and by that i mean sure you can ask a question like what is the number of payments monthly,0.9645,0.106,0.006,0.888
high,won,company product,sales engineer but even something as simple as okay i want to drill down and ask the next question on this spike things like that you cant even do so its it can answer those first questions fine but in terms of doing anything analytically complex any sort of drill down iteration thats where it starts to strugglefrom my perspectivegot it yeah that helps,0.9253,0.213,0.0,0.787
high,won,demo,clientthat didnt make me sick or something so is this like either the way its normally set up or what youre showing now is it too when you are asking that is it pinging against extract the data or is it pinging against the source at that timesales engineer so it is all a live connection to third party vendor so were not moving the data into company in memory engine or a data extract its all going live against third party vendor you guys obviously invested a ton there so were saying leave the data where it is and and part of the power third party vendor and just live query itclient so its building is basically building the query sending that third party vendor link third party vendor run it and send the data back yeahsales engineer yep exactlyclientremoved   removed how does that work when we have hundreds of millions of rows of transaction data especially as we see fit something gets logged in and well run those queries on third party vendor im sure that will impact usage costs on the third party vendor side right now right im hearing costs on third party vendorclientclientclientclient yeah yeah copy or see per compute costs yeah yeah yeah sorry go ahead name no go aheadsales engineerclientsales engineer theres kind of two parts to it from a performance perspective we have customers like who name for example that are big third party vendor customers they use company on removed of data and one of their tables and austrian great performance,0.9934,0.196,0.017,0.787
high,won,pricing,sales engineer thats part of the beauty of third party vendor is that it scales to your point though yes that does use third party vendor credits while we see though from just the total cost of ownership that credit usage for asking a question or two is so much less that dollar amount is so much less than someone having to submit a request that goes through a report developer they built a dashboard,0.9432,0.207,0.0,0.793

high,won,about company,sales engineer yeah ill ill say in about three minutes ill actually show you how do we go from data and third party vendor to something like this and company got itclient one thing that client said made me think of and i dont know if you necessarily have answer i dont know how to ask it per se but i think adoption of new tools like this new bi tools is its not high in our groups and so if youve experienced if youve worked with all these other companies is there were there you know as we get into this would be good to learn you know things what youve learned about how to increase adoption by end users for tools about company ends client i mean weve had other tools where are we showing them these cool things you can do and thats how they interpret these things right or some cool but thenremoved   removedto get people out and actually using it and given us feedback is not that high and i know thats not on you guys as the vendor but youve worked with others that maybe youve learned some things,0.9377,0.103,0.028,0.87
high,won,onboarding,account executive yeah awesome would definitely be curious your perspective on that but run one of the things that we like to do and weve got quite a bit of time between now and when we actually roll out the plc during the plc wed like to get this in the hands of the users that will actually use it and prove out the value so before you guys buy a product you guys are actually confirming the value that your customer base would or would not get and you can actually track the adoption throughout the two or three week plc see whos using it what see what types of questions are being asked et cetera,0.9542,0.16,0.0,0.84
high,won,about company,account executive but between now and we kick off the plc wed be happy to you know if you guys have generally the best folks to test company are the ones that are sending in the most requests getting the most ad hoc requests from thats a good group to test the tool like this out with as well as those business users that maybe are just not not technical enough even for a tool like third party vendor those are generally the places we start confirm the value industry issues ends account executive and then that way you know going in whether or not its going to be a tool that youwell makes sense howclientand but if were looking at a graph on the advanced data are there different iterations of how we can visualize that graph whether its bar line or a pie chart orclientas your as were doing this how is it came out with my question,0.9872,0.184,0.0,0.816
high,won,about company,clientremoved   removedsales engineer yeah for sure hop up in this all the standard stuff you would expect and then you can change your colors and number foraring and all that good stuffclient that ticket to this this is some of the value of company to is it its looking at what youre pulling in and kind of trying to pick the right what it thinks is the best visualization for the data that youre looking at rightsales engineer yeah if a teacher using the date field for example its gonna put something on the line charts and knows that thats the best way to visualize something over time or if youre looking at two measures itll make it a scatter plot by default but its all very easily to change things if if needed as well one other,0.9436,0.143,0.0,0.857
high,won,company product,clientsales engineer thing from the search perspective wanted to show you guys is part of that intelligence component of of company so lets say we have a simple search like this whats our weekly payment amounts and i can see there is this huge spike in march of this year and i want to figure out what changed between the week before that and then and of course we can search and drill down and ask a bunch of questions to figure that out there is also the auto analysis component of company work and say hey just look at this data slice and dice and all these different combinations and tell me what the most significant drivers that increase are and what that results in as something like this where payment amount went from removed between those two weeks and here are the biggest driver so removed of our removed cities have the biggest increase for see city accounted for removed of the change or here are claims that were the biggest increases or heres the specialty that drove the biggest increase so its not meant to be a full on data science tool replacing highly paid data scientists at your organization but its really meant to augment that non technical user and offer them some additional insights as theyre exploring the data and then with all of that its still live interactive company where someone says hey thats understand this but specialty drove the increase i wonder if it was a particular claim type or a particular practitioner or whatever the next question is you can always ask it and then also get a feedback so maybe you always know that the largest removed in city is always going to be the biggest driver of increases so you could say hey its actually is not insightful or hey something brand new popped up super interesting give it a thumbs up the point is the more feedback and get more to run the more insightful this type of thing becomes every timeremoved   removedclient yeah i i see that this is extremely valuable just because the every day and non technical user role would have to do these drill downs to figure out what change company product ends client so if we know there was an increase and denials they would have to build down and figure out exactly where that being curious wasnt the only way to do that is by doing the additional you know in in our case would be putting data in excel doing pivots im trying to figure out exactly whats driving it so i see this as i see this is a very cool feature that would helpclient yeah it could be a way to get people out of using excel although i know that theres some cool stuff coming with third party vendor and direct excel going to data sets and things like that with pivot tables but thats still pretty rudimentary compared to what youre seeing here industry issues client speaking of excel i was gonna ask question because as soon as you put this in front of a user theyre gonna ask the questions how do i how do i download the data behind it theyre gonna let us get that data out and no nameer how much we push and show them they can do it all here and there and are there limits so hes going to be the smaller question you know data transfer sales engineer yeah you can always download any of your charts as an excel file you can also view the underlying data if you want the actual transaction level details behind a certain data point and you could say hey i want to grab all these data download it as an excel file as well so multiple options there pinboard client yeah and im assuming you can share right that little share buttonsales engineerremoved   removed yeah exactly or or lead me to where exactly where i was going so you can either shared from that search experience do you want to share an individual chart i had been pinging these things along the way to this newly created dashboard and then from here i could follow it and say i want in my email on a regular basis on whatever schedule i choose or share it to your question and i could say hey i want to give access to my executives theyre going to be viewers or editors depending on who im giving access to what access level they have say this out ill hit share that group will get an email and say sales engineer to share it out this pin board with you and itll be a direct link back back here in the company and then they can begin exploring so jumping right in can begin exploring here without having to go straight to the full on search experience so you can just start to ask the questions from here and i could say i wanna look at the specialty do my drill down all within this pin board experience again were just not enough rebuilding this these past that they have to go downclient  so if we name this is a static view pinboard ends client so lets say i send it to somebody today and i look at it three days from now are they looking at this specific view as of june  second or is it refresh when they look at it and if it doesnt refresh that they have the ability to refresh,0.9989,0.138,0.007,0.856
high,won,company product,sales engineer its a live query to third party vendor the whole time so when they popping it up those will be query sent to third party vendor okayclientclient yeah im going back to the the cpu or the cost side of third party vendor i mean if you get a lot of users looking at different things all the time its going to add up so that thats definitely a consideration butclient yeah at the same time if theyre all sorry manclientremoved   removed and you kinda bounced that go ahead client lets say at the same time like if theyre all looking at this dashboard though that that the query that sending us the same and third party vendor has the cached data you know that where it will it will reuse cache data data architecture ends client so you know i it would be the exploration piece that would be is going to be added to it mostly not a bunch of people looking at the dashboard but yeahthat thatwe lose you runname i think i think we lostokayyeahokayclientaccount executiveclientclientclientaccount executiveyep client and actually everybody that is a great point on one of the things we also encourage is get it into a realistic number of users hands for the trial so you can also measure get at least a sample size of the third party vendor costsclientyou had mentioned some sales engineer just curious use,0.9754,0.136,0.019,0.846
high,won,company product,clientremoved   removed do you said i can follow it so it sends me an email every day or something what does it send a link does it send like snapshot of the date dashboardsales engineer yeah its a pdf as of the scheduled time okay so if i say i want this wednesday at nine am itll run this pin board nine am as a pdf send me that along with the link back tohere okayi was going to hit on theclientsales engineerthird party vendor connection piece before i do that other questions about the the end user experiencedclient i had a follow on question to the exporting the data to you know excel or different formats are there are limits to that i mean i know and third party vendor we have a removed limit for dashboards and things like that i dont know industry issues ends sales engineeri can i can find out though make note of thatbe good to knowclientclienti would think yeah i would think i would what i would wonder if set a limit that third party vendor path is passed on to this because i know third party vendor has about  meg limit if thats data architecture clientremoved   removed thats in the in the just the thats the ui thats an name thats not like not a data thennot a querylimitation yeahyeah i can find outsales engineerclientsales engineerclientyoure saying client youre saying that if you connect into third party vendor via their proprietary tool youll have a limit on your query data architecture ends client but yeah i also use the beer and theres no limit there so okayclientsales engineeraccount executivesales engineercool wellthey hit onwhat does it take to get to this experience what we see on the left here this is whats called the worksheet thats the semantic layer and company to an end user,0.9369,0.09,0.009,0.901
high,won,company product,sales engineer it just appears as a single object where they dont have to worry about what are the joins behind the scenes how do these tables relate to each other what was theremoved   removedfield name called and stuff like et cetera what that looks like behind the scenes is something like this where in this case it was a pretty simple example we had a single fact and a couple of dimension tables but weve essentially pointed company to third party vendor data management  functions ends sales engineer suddenly want to connect to these tables and then done some further clean up and by that i mean cleaning up our column names adding synonyms so this is really important in terms of making it as easy as possible for the end user where you can see we have this field called cover type but there are sent an for insurance coverage et cetera and by creating the synonyms when users go into search they can ask the same question five different ways and the query thats generated is going to be the exact same because company knows those five different terms all refer to the same field in third party vendor and just to show you what it looks like to connect to third party vendor im gonna edit this connection here,0.9864,0.154,0.0,0.846
high,won,demo,sales engineer so we dont have to watch me enter some credentials but essentially were going to point to third party vendor answer credentials and it could be a service account where youre defining security within company layer could also use off to pass the security onto third party vendor if you have rules and rolls already been defined at the third party vendor layer data management  functions sales engineer its a hey just pass that on from company the third party vendor and so youre not recreating and sort of logic there and now were connecting to the tables that we want to expose in company so i can come here say i want to join to these retail tables just coming to coming here check the box yeah were not moving data data at all were just telling company what we want to expose im gonna hit update company is going to go look if there are any primary foreign key relationships already defined on the third party vendor side if there are then company will inherit those you dont have to create a new joins and company much you want to change them if theyre not defined then well simply come in here this case they were defined we would come in here to our joins say added join i want to connect thats facts that dimension on product id tell company with the card analogy is and hit create join so pretty simple process here again this is that upfront setup work but it sounds like probably your team would would be doing of defining what these data models are how tables relate to each other data management  functions ends removed   removedsales engineer and then from there its a removed of curating this worksheet so coming in here edit in exactly what fields we want to expose so maybe you have a table that has  columns thats your users its gonna be overwhelming if they start with  columns and search experience maybe you only expose  of them for example and then its that final level of curation you can add formulas filters that type of thing but then itll be the final level of curation of cleaning up this met a data and making it super business user friendly and then you can apply any security object level row column level et cetera if neededclient so i see you know heres where you define center so known synonyms what if what if does it does the ai learn from what people are asking like so if someone search for i dont know what a good example postal code and says zip code and what would it do would it to say unlike an unknown element and then maybe give it a list to pick from and they would learn that when someone says postcall they mean zip codesales engineer yeah some it looks like we already have defined here actually think interesting so this might be a good example actually there are some prebuilt synonyms that company just knows that its intelligent enough that even if you dont have sales defined as a sign on for revenue it will know that thats the thing that people are most likely intending to search on so theres some of that intelligence based on under the hood that itll know automatically if someone just typed in general share company its not gonna know what that maps to so in that case that would be something that needs to be added as a send them if it is a valid thing their administrative use that or youre able to track all the searches people are doing so if you all of a sudden see a spike in searches and everyone searching for a field that is not turned on or exposed or theres not a set it and created for it you could easily go back and add it says multiple ways that that would be handled client just depending on the situationclient i think the the history of like search seeing what is being searched would would take care of that because then you can its not gonna help them right theyre theyre searching but it would help yeah clean like you said like manage that list and things like thatsales engineer yeah and then if if they do say hey i need to sending them its a  second activity for someone to come in here add it saves and then youre goodaccount executiveremoved   removed so quick question for you guys what this here the semantic layer to envision this being managed client by by your group or client and client your group or name do you think this is something that id be managed byclient i think to me it depends on how we if you know if we decided to do this kind of department by department you know so if like revenue cycle wants to roll this out and you have data sources that you think would be you know good fact dimensional model data sources and we would you know it could be the type of thing where if you have the budget to move forward with this product but we dont overall with the enterprise view that maybe it makes sense to move it out per department like maybe rehab lab removed hp tv and then you know you have since youre paying for it you would have more control over no under the hood and be able to build these models now if it was a different you know payment methodology or theres more of an enterprise overview or purview over it then maybe itll be different maybe h i would do more of the underlying connections and some of that depends on the third party vendor side as well and how you know the the costing is associated with that and what sources are being used so i think wed have to figure out kind of a methodology around that but you know what were looking for is to be able to get this into the hands of of the teams that are really interested in having this flip this kind of flexibility with data and being able too heavier users explore it and it doesnt really take that much to leverage you know this tool versus other tools data management  functions client like for example what were really thinking about is once we get caboodle out into removed and the richness of all the data models that existing caboodle we can connect directly to that caboodle all your coffee and have you know  or  different data models ready to go in this tool data management  functions ends client and then we could also leverage those same day and models in third party vendor so the good thing about that is you have a single source of truth thats being driven out to these different visualization tools and you have very limited variation of the data results which is really nice and its less overhead too so wed have to look at you know what does that look like through your lens and figure out from a removed billing perspective you know what type of resources you have to do this type of work and does it make sense administratively or is should it be some parts of it be centralized within hr we havent got that farclientremoved   removed yeah and i would say i agree name too i think i could see it either way i dont theres nothing about this that would like worried me about us you know owning the responsibility and and setup of it its just more coming down to like you were saying that the the discussions around the the proper way or the you know the right way based on payment you know cost toothe supportingall thatclientaccount executiveclientso where are we got in this process because i heard that were doing a plc soon or armyclient yeah so right now were looking to try to establish kind have a footprint of this technology within our network and be able to spin up you know with all the proper security and stuff some actual removed billing data i believe in middle of august to middle of september and and then have like two or three week period where we have you know removed billing users and you guys in there playing with the day to you know massaging it getting it just you know kicking it around a little bit and so we can track performance we can track you know how its behaving in the third party vendor world security things like that really just kinda look under the hood and get it get it going and evaluate if its something that we want to pursue further i mean thats kind of where were at right now we dont know if were going to move forward with it but we we really like the capability and we think it could be a good fit to our overall portfolio so we just want to test it out with us for billing and see see what you think yeah sounds goodclient,0.9994,0.124,0.029,0.847
high,won,about company,client i mean based on the this chart demo it seems like it would be extremely valuable especially as we move into third party vendor and you know in the problem with the adoption rate especially in you know wherever universities is the fact that its not very intuitive and you you know i think leaders are afraid to go in there and and you know folks are really afraid to kinda get into it because it can be overwhelming as far as how you can use it even though somewhat simple once you start doing itremoved   removed yeah onboarding process clientaccount executive about company ends client but i think something easy and intuitive like this tool would be very beneficial you know do it im doing it correctlyclient name i think the i think the barrier to getting into this tool and starting as much lower than others yeah to what to what you said account executive and sales engineer i mean thats key benefit of it its its pretty low barriers to someone to go in and see a search bar and start typing something yeah absolutely thats thats what were seeing since weve got so were meeting with just to give you guys an idea of timing weve gone through a bunch of security reviews paperwork all kinds of stuff with name and and then name groups logger and arc and so weve done a lot of the the back end processes what i were meeting with the api team leadership team on the nineteenth to kind of walkthrough milestones and timelines of what the plc will look like but between now and when we kick that off were happy to work with both of you if you get if you guys have a group of users that you want to expose this to and see who would be interested in raising their hand and using it during the trial that that could be a great way to get going or if you wanted to do it in more one off situations are smaller groups onboarding process ends account executive sales engineer and i are happy to meet with as many folks as as you guys want to expose this to between now and when the plc starts yeah,0.9955,0.161,0.03,0.808
high,won,deployment options,clientclient hi this pc i was probably going to support the platform as a system admin so im not sure how far the the speed setup or talk about the environment the pcremoved   removedenvironment anyone has started that that that part of the test yes you have a better idea but anytime if i can be any help id be happy to such as to set up a vm in the removed hi or many components needed like to take a look at you have documentation setting itclient yeah so i dont know client have you met account executive and sales engineer yet or is this,0.9564,0.18,0.014,0.806
high,won,small talk,client i met them virtually probably a couple of times so this probably my third time ive been just listening watching okay i know the people i need to go toclient yeah so easy just so account executive and sales engineer are you using as a senior bi platform administrator for under name room slacker small talk ends client so sure it sounds like using will be the person to really do some of the heavy lifting from an infrastructure perspective so thatll be great to make that connection if if you havent alreadyaccount executive i definitely recognize the name but yeah easy were happy to schedule a follow up time and go into as much detail as you likesure thatll be great thank youyeah the idea go ahead i was agenda clientclientclientwhat would be some documentation or videos that we can socialize a month you know our leadership to kind of get some thoughts around this and you know possibly you know the demo like the one we saw today because i think if we can getremoved   removedit in front of their eyes and you know you can see that the tool is you know would be valuable and see a benefit in and i think thatll be helpful along the processaccount executive yeah no problem ill follow up via email and and get you guys a you know a piece of collateral as well as a youtube link coolclientclient yeah and if we need to if you client if youd like to set up another demo with some of your leaders or other revenue cycle years we could probably set that up id like to request that we have either me or account executive or indoor members flagger you know on on those calls just so we can kind of be part of that process and you know dovetail then anything that were working on internally with an h as wellclient yepclient  be a good way to kinda socialize it agenda ends client and also its we want to be a little bit careful because its not you know we havent made a decision yet to move forward with it so our messaging what has to be nuanced but at the same time its an opportunity for people to see the possibilities that are out there with these tools that are very different from what we have currently helloclientclient yeah because i mean if they if they see value in the tool and they would see a benefit from the non technical user yeahclientremoved   removedclient using it then i think you know i im sure we can provide some push or they can provide some insight into getting this as well as you know kinda understanding,0.9975,0.18,0.023,0.797
high,won,onboarding,client yeah i know ive been getting worse too early for you to understand what that price structure would be so that it can be consideredaccount executive yeah absolutely and the goal from a broader session with your users client would be to find five to  yeahclientaccount executive that you guys would trust their opinion on him would be available for a couple of sessions during the plc to really test it out yep sounds good onboarding process ends clientclient yeah another reason why were meeting on the nineteenth is to look at whats the success criteria that were looking for you know what are the things that we want to test whether its security or you know role level security access performance what is the cost you know spinning up on the third party vendor side how easy is it to set up you know the connection and the synonyms and the data sets based on data sets we already have who are the right people to administer it you know stuff like that theres a long list of questions that we need to get figure it out,0.9771,0.159,0.015,0.826
high,won,deployment options,client and then maybe on your side client and and client you could think about that too like when youre testing things what what would you like tests like would you like to test the limit of extracting data out of it performance and then also you know im im sure you want to be able to do aggregate calculations or indoorremoved   removedwhich i dont think we showed today but you can take you know two fields and bring them together and make a some or you know concatenation or whatever within the tool itself and save that so its pretty flat cool,0.9569,0.191,0.0,0.809
high,won,onboarding,clientclient have you so have you given thought to like the data source were going to use for the plc i mean we mentioned removed billing but like what actual tables are we going to use now i mentioned that mainly because right now the the main rev revenue cycle data is in the dms were not its not in synergy synergy onboarding process client hasnt been fully updated to provide all the accurate data that dns does so im just curious if you if you have or is that still under discussionclient i think its still under discussion right now because im not im wasnt as close to the dns layer data to see if it would be something that would perform the way that we would expect it to you in in a tool like company onboarding process ends client and you probably know more about that than i do is it because that was just more from bringing the universities over right itclientclient was bring in the yeah the like the  models but i think maybe theres two thoughts i have one is the one reason why i asked that is you know synergy is obviously set up perfect mentions but if we use that and its not showing the same data that like if we have actual users in there and theyre seeing data thats not representative of what theyre expecting thats going to cover their experience and feedbackremoved   removed,0.9775,0.102,0.0,0.898
high,won,pricing,client so id rather use the data that theyre theyre used to seeing that were pulling that we validated but that does lead me to the question you know when i saw you sales engineer set up like show the setup of this removed layer it doesnt seem like its it needs to certain structure like a need to star scheme of fact i mentioned model it probably performs better but thats basically dependent on third party vendor performance at that point two right or is there some kind of dependency or some kind of vantage and company to having a certain modeling technique in the back end source no itsclientsales engineer its typical analytics modeling best practices meaning were not going to grab the removed tables from any rfp say go right so it could be a third party vendor star could be a highly be normalized a single table that all comes back to how third party vendor compute joins yeahclientsales engineer but ultimately you want it needs to be something where when a user searches that result make sense so like having multiple fact tables that different levels of time granularity could cause confusing results for example so thats just part of the exercise of figuring out whats the business challenge what are the questions they wanna ask and then does the data or is the data model appropriately today or what changes need to be madeclient yeah that makes sense so name you know like as far as like the tables we theyre theyre that latter the latter example would it sales engineers that theyre that name normalized right its a single table that we put every all the data points in and so i think we could use it its not probably the most ideal but i think we could but yeah im sure that you know name would want to have some thoughts in that because it might you might want to also test something where it is in fact the mentioned or we might want to have some comparisons to right data management  functions ends clientremoved   removed yeah yeah i mean it could be that maybe theres i mean theres the removed billing perspective for sure but then i wonder if we could do some removed testing to maybe a different data model or something like that i mean i mean we could the idea here is to to prove out the worse you know its worth and you know is it something that we want to pursue data management  functions client and then at that point and we make all kinds of decisions on what now what data models makes sense to really do the right way and what do we have available versus what should we be building just apply multiple downstream reporting tool needs so yeah and were data management  functions ends client echo what client insane i think you know doing that plc and to show the worth at least for my revenue cycle standpoint is really having the user experience what they can do with the data that they know or that they that they can ask the right questions where i think would go a long way,0.9968,0.15,0.022,0.828
high,won,next steps,account executive yeah one of the best ways to is to work backwards when we talked to those businesses findclientaccount executive out the questions they have and then we can work backwards to make sure that yeahclientclient yeah so maybe you know were gonna meet on july nineteenth internally and hr but you know maybe we need to client do you want to connect and client at some point between now and you know two three weeks from now so that you can start thinking about what you want to test and and what people might need to beremoved   removedpart of another demo and stuff like that and then we can get back with account executive and you know figure out what next steps are for you yeah that sounds goodclientclient okay well maybe ill just set up another session with a three at least maybe name too and or what do you want client with the three of us be fine or would you like to agenda client we have us would be fine yeah i think that sounds good okay ill do thatclientclient yeah and i think in the meantime we get those like links to the youtube or that or this end or this recording we can you know share that with name and name so they they start seeing and we can we will have some calls with them or we can get some of their feedback as well,0.9878,0.185,0.027,0.788

high,won,about company,account executive and so as part of this we wanted to as i mentioned exposed company to this broader audience and then and then go from there please feel free to jump in and ask questions about company account executive you can use the chat board and sales engineer will monitor while im going and then vice versa so for those of you that are familiar company was founded in remove and our founders came from third party vendor and what they wanted to bring to the market and what they felt was missing from traditional bi tools which there are many in remove search types account executive when we started the company was the idea of search on enterprise data just like you would interact with in a purchase in your personal life when you have a question youd go to third party vendor youd ask a question you get the answer back right away company wanted to deliver that for enterprise data and so we have a robust search bar that you can place right on top of in your case remove data we pair that with ai driven insights so over time company well get to know the users better as they search their data company will elevate the keywords that make the most sense and have a really seamless search experience company product account executive we also pair that with a anomaly detection or an ai insight engine so if you see a spike in or an anomaly and a visualization you can run company product and and we will elevate what we believe are the under underlying causes of that anomali the technology and or the search and ai technology of let us do some of the largest customers in the world a couple that to highlight about company account executiveremoved   removed here removed has removed merchandisers so these are non technical business users they dont know sequel they dont know how to use third party vendor or any other bi tools but theyre responsible for setting pricing at a purse shelf per skew level and so company was brought in because the previous tool third party vendor didnt have the performance to handle that level of granulariy apples another good use case this is a more technical audience where its a team of analysts from a genius bar perspective that you company to analyze i phoned repair data and ask them is a good one in particular because its in the remove space they we just brought them on last quarter data architecture account executive and when we first connected to their data theyre also a third party vendor customer we were up in searching removed and about  minutes so just gives you an idea of the performance that company can deliver the technology customers have let us into some leadership positions within bi about company account executive most notably is that middle bar there on the right exciting news within the last month company or im sorry third party vendors venture portfolio has invested in company so they are not only one of our top technology partners theyre also now an investor and company so what youll see from that is continued very very we will continue to be very aligned to both technically and from a go to market standpoint with third party vendor deployment options account executive we also are our top partners with name and a name which i know is important for you guys removed any questions here before we continue on all right well keep it rolling data architecture account executive so whats the challenge at company is solving i think client is a great example you guys have already taken the lead and modernized from a data management perspective and so you have invested in third party vendor you understand the benefits of having the data in a very easy to manage elastic low cost way of storing data industry issues removed   removedaccount executive but what were finding is that even though the data is now stored in that modern methodology its still very difficult for people to get access to that data into make educated business driven decisions on that data and this is the pipeline that we see most customers most of our customers go through where they have different organizations that they support those organizations are delivered a dashboard and oftentimes that dashboard doesnt answer all the questions that may answer one or two of the questions they have but it doesnt drill down to that next level or that find the screen of detail and thats because his removed tools didnt have the horse power or performance to be able to to accommodate that very massive level of granularity and so company proposition is to flip this paradigm around and rather than push dashboards out to the business give the business a search bar so they can ask the questions of their data on their own and a good example of this removed which is basically the removed of canada about company account executive when they before company they had about removed people interacting with bi tools and since theyve rolled out company thats now over a removed people that are using data to make decisions just give you guys a little bit of a context there on what company can enable in terms of adoption search types account executive so lastly this is the proposition that company delivers we want to take our customers from static dashboards to this iterative search experience on the right where you have a question you ask it you get the best fit visualization back and then from there if you want go down to that next level you either add add a keyword or you can just drill right down into the visualization to get to that next level which sales engineer ill show you in a second the key here is speed any any sort of search experience is the user experience is critical you want to be able to get those answers back right away and so company we have a full value index so youre never searching within a vacuum you can always drill down to that next level of granularity our query engine translate sequel to english the table stakes there but we are able to do at a massive scale and handle very complex table structures,0.9977,0.093,0.015,0.892
high,won,deployment options,account executive and and then lastly from an architecture perspective were both built for the cloud era cloud era we have that modern feel with with all of the enterprise security features and functionality that youd expect of a of an enterprise software im gonna pause here and pass it over to sales engineer for the demo but while i do that any questions from any of the folks that havent seen company beforeremoved   removed,0.1779,0.023,0.0,0.977
high,won,agenda,clientgreat and hopefully youre demoing the anomaly stuff tooyep alright andothers that havesales engineeraccount executive deployment options ends client i have two questions im hoping i think they probably they will be address at some point the demo which is fine so one is around you talking about like search engines but like the thing that really has made the biggest difference in third party vendor in the last  years is the integration the knowledge graph right of taking like its like were searching for keywords to like we understand the facts in a particular way and so like understanding the equivalent or like the direction that that might look but i look like in our data would be one thing the other thing would be you know being able to do this kind of stuff fast and unpredictable way it makes me nervous about like how big of like a cluster were gonna need to keep warm or like what that looks like its like the fact like how we scale to utilization in a way that keeps us im not wasting resources but also able to be responsive to changes in demand im sorry mans got fluctuate a ton during that like not as much as maybe like places that just like have an audit and off time right we have some people running stuff in the middle of the night but not very many and so they just being able to to handle that variation demandaccount executive great questions thanks trust and sales engineer lets lets lets work backwards and start with the second one yeah and then and i dont make sense tosales engineer on it as we go name so what im planning to do is well spend the first  minutes or so on the end user experience so how someone ultimately in the business will interact with company then well pop up in the hood talk about the back end how we connect to third party vendor that will have some applications trust into your question about load and peak times and stuff like that and then we can hit on those along the wayclientremoved   removedquestions ill plausibletheandclientsales engineerway feel free to unmute then or if something pops up in your head just hit it in the chat where were goingclientsales engineerim gonna share out my screen here you guys see that okay great soi saidim gonna start,0.9988,0.25,0.02,0.731
high,won,about company,clientclientsales engineeras an end user so as im going through this piece think of me as someone who interacts with third party vendor third party vendor you name the tool today and that may serve  percent of my needs but its when i have that new question where something is not built into a dashboard thats when i have challenges because i dont know how to use third party vendor desktop im not someone whos going in and modifying a third party vendor report but i have those questions so typically i go to my analyst i hit up an analytics team and that takes time and it said im gonna use company to help with that so company ofaccount executivesales engineer course company and create dashboards like any other tool but when i start to dive in here this is where the differences begin to emerge and if you think about a traditional dashboard you might have five  filters across the top are on the right and those are the predefine ways that you can slice and dice your dashboard by but again what happens if i have that  filter thats not fairremoved   removed instead here on the rightclientsales engineer final thing on thenamesales engineer,0.9678,0.114,0.0,0.886
high,won,company product, and company nothing is prebuilt so for one company looking at the actual questions that users are asking them this data and then make your recommendation so here it means lots of users are asking about thompson memorial specifically so company saying hey you might wanna take a look at this,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0
high,won,demo,sales engineer your peers are asking questions about it we can just quickly click and weve got a new filter there additionally this is the beginning of search where i know about something very specific in my data that i want to ask about and i can just begin typing so i dont have to worry about where the data what field does removed and just like i would go on third party vendor and begin typing i can do that here dashboard is hey i wanna i wanna dive in deeper here and i want to drill down and again the theme is that theres not a predefine way i have to go so as a user here i can drill to any direction to any level of granularity data drill down ends sales engineer of course there are some guardrails that we put up and well talk about that when we get to the back end but its given usability the user the ability to go wherever they want within this dataset here hi name this isclientsales engineerremoved   removed just a jumping off point where we have a dashboard and company rather than hitting a wall we can alter and augmented with a lot of flexibility,0.8922,0.084,0.0,0.916
high,won,about company,sales engineer the flip side and really the core of company though is search and thats where hey i have a brand new question its not in the dashboard i wanna just free form ask it like i would go on third party vendor or third party vendor to find something so lets start with a high level question,0.8807,0.183,0.0,0.817
high,won,demo,sales engineer i wanna see how many removed we have by specialty and youll see as im typing here company making suggestions so as i type its its not just looking at the columns and names and my data but its actually every individual value and this is that search index that account executive mentioned behind the scenes data drill down sales engineer is as im typing company to making suggestions so i dont have to go looking for a specific field i know i have something very specific in mind that im looking for and im just gonna start typing lets say i wanna look at this on a monthly basis,0.4767,0.029,0.0,0.971
high,won,company product,sales engineer at any point lets say hey this is interesting i want to create my own dashboard here im gonna save this off and ive just added it to share with other people ill pause here any questions so farname i have a quick question here this is may have so many of put things in your search bar here data management  functions name we might have different definition of the things where people are writing here does it show here like from which table its grabbing the spear dotcom i just showremoved   removedthe underlying data source heresales engineer yeah yeah good good question a couple of things there well talk a little bit more about this when we actually walkthrough connecting to third party vendor but on the left here this care provider this is whats called a worksheet so this is how the scope of what were searching on is defined okay okaynamesales engineer to me as an end user i have no idea what tables these are this is one table this is  tables what the scheme is because im a business person and i dont care now behind the scenes in this case its actually five tables and star schemer data management  functions ends sales engineer so all of this combined to get to a point where its single and clean to the end user and well well talk about what that actually looks like to to build thatname it will be always based on one subject on the left hand side and then youll put your question and all those questions should be alerted to that subject good provided in this case its not searching a whole third party vendor what it back its just searching that area or do you need differentsales engineer yeah its not just an open search bar to third party vendor whatever i find in the scope okay the worksheet yes sounds good thank younamesales engineer cool good question so so lets say as this user im curious about what happened in march and removed where the most removed there and i wanna dig in further and again we can go wherever we want to hear so i could say i want to jump to the removed level and then within thompson memorial i want to drill down to the trackremoved   removed sure level im just kind ofclientsales engineer,0.9979,0.219,0.011,0.771
high,won,demo, iterating asking the next question and then maybe im curious about just three admitted removed and again i can just type that in search weve found these  yourself removed and i like more of a tabular view so ill pop over here and then we can get some more details about exactly what was going data drill down ends sales engineer so we can say whats the patient name what are the outstanding tests whats their h group and what was their pre release risk so im starting with this really highlevel question and drill down added things to my search and ive got to the point where i found the  removed,0.5398,0.087,0.049,0.864
high,won,company product,sales engineer maybe i want to sort by who are the youngest ones and we found exactly who these folks are getting maybe i find this interesting so ill send this off to my dashboard and part of whats allowing this to happen is that company is not pre aggregating data or forcing you to create any cubes beforehand,0.2284,0.103,0.057,0.839
high,won,demo,sales engineer we want to connect to whatever the most granular relational data you have in third party vendor so whether its the encounter level the prescription level whatever that most granular thing is connect with that and company and then you can allow users to get to start with that high level question and then drill down to something super granular like this where i found that individual practitioner or a patient level type thing data drill down ends sales engineer so thats one question lets lets do something a little bit more advanced here and im curious about our average length of stay well look at it on a weekly basis and previously there were a lot of heart failure related removed that we had foundremoved   removedand im curious about who are my top doctors that have removed with heart failure of risk and whats the average length of stay for that particular cohort of customers lets say i wanna look at my practitioner and i just care about this top five practitioner if i could spell practitioner and im just curious about heart failure and i wanna see just the top five based on patient count so something pretty data drill down account executivesales engineer simple looking in search we look at whats going on behind the scenes is company is actually constructed fairly sophisticated sequel where its cohort of this out create a sub query and we can find something here where it looks like there was actually a spike at the end of removed for average length of stay for that particular cohort,0.9767,0.15,0.041,0.809
high,won,company product,sales engineer so thats the fairly simple question ive asked a little bit more advanced question i also want to have company help with my analysis here so lets say were looking at heart failure read minutes  days and i wanna look at it hi h group now of course we continue to drill down and figure out okay ill be  plus removed what was their risk what are they over survey scores et cetera et cetera we can also have company help with this analysis so im gonna kick this off and what its doing behind the scenes is it slicing and dicing every possible combination here and then running algorithms on top of that outlier detection looking for trends looking for correlations and figuring out what it is statistically significant in this data so wasnt a particular combination of prerelease risk and location and occupation that had significantly higher length of stay or whatever that outlier insight is and what that results into something like this where company whats the data found  insights on four and a half  rows so pretty small data set but for example it said hey for this particular each group this particular provider had higher significantly higher average exit scores then everything else company product ends sales engineer and as i scroll through here theres a variety of incentives for this h group removed had significantly higher  days readmit then any other specialclientremoved   removed kind of corrections on these its like we had youre dealing with a group that was doing something similar or is it in a very like constrained data domain right where theyre like okay so what are the outliers or just people are doing significantly better or worse for cost for a certain procedure and then like okay what are the things that theyre doing that are different right like what are the components of the of the surgery that theyre like the the hardware that theyre using or whatever the supplies theyre using company product client that seems to make a difference and the the point that that we struggled with was this group is just like look youre all these statistically significant results or like yeah but i mean like if you cast a net over like just competent name youll space right you feel like removed possible combinations youre gonna find a bunch of stuff even incomplete noise so like respond was there i guess whats thesales engineerclient so the question what are your thoughts about that right like how to make sure youre not surfacing clientsales engineer gotcha so so just to level set this is not meant to be like a full on machine learning data science replacement its really meant to give the business some direction to things that might be interesting so with all of this in terms of correction the the primary way for a non technical person would be to provide that feedback so that initial run there might be some noise because company is never received feedback on prompt data so we can say hey this is actually not interesting because we already know that is always going to be an outlier or whatever the feedback that youre giving it is the only other really thing you would do is for the more statistically advanced people is it just tuning some of these knobs to say hey we only consider something significant when the key value is point one company product ends sales engineer and i point out five or whatever those knobs would be those are some initial thoughts trust and i imagine youre doing some pretty deep data science stuff so wed love your feedback on just that initial stuffclientremoved   removed i mean i i the the the blind search thing is like a problem but i i i respect that i think that the way that youre doing it would be like yeah thats not an appropriate thing to think about is probably the best way to just like surfacing it and getting in front of people but i still i still where like the you know the bond for any corrections a good example of like a way of like this is how many things that were looking at so were gonna make sure that we only surface things that account for you know there that are more rare than we would expect given the fact that were doing this many comparisons or something but thats thats the kind of stuff that seems like those are like i current best ideas,0.9993,0.198,0.027,0.774
high,won,company product,sales engineer gotcha yeah its good feedback and and trust in at some point i probably makes sense to connect you and whoever else is interested with even like our co founders who were really deep on this part of our products at the end of the day that the core of company is search and allowing users to get the start of the quick add hawk questions search types ends sales engineer and this is really so bonus but its that second leg thats thats hey we want to go beyond search and get some like dip our toes into something thats more statistical stuffname hey i have a quick question before you go further so when we work on third party vendor right search types name we we also have like a qa feature there so once we make our data set like we can turn on that queue and name and then what i would it be or i think the right keywords it can search that data set and like get us answers to the questions what we are writing search types ends name so im just wondering how that differs from company as providing here and thumbs up in the future if you have used that probably be a qa featureremoved   removedsales engineerhey i saw you come off mute there if you want to respond and i tend toaccount executiveyeah sure is it pronounced me,0.9828,0.138,0.0,0.862
high,won,about company,account executivehuh is that correct yeah basically a good question theres a handful of companies that have added search to their platforms over time since company came into the market theyre really to address the the gap that they had as company pursued search and was having a lot of success is the biggest difference youre gonna find is from a performance perspective company is very is very much the leader in that space of returning quick answers at the most granular level and it also requires significantly less setup from what weve heard we can also bring in we have a an expert that evaluates all technologies and we just had a presentation last week on third party vendor version of search so happy to to bring them in to share some of the differences as well sales engineer any additional thoughts you have yeahsales engineer yeah i kinda put third party vendor q and a and the same bucket as as third party vendor last data how was that third party vendor before before coming over to company search types sales engineer and yes they do have search but from what weve seen from customers its not truly something that users are using in production to ask real business value question so its kind of an add on module that really company core and our philosophy is that searches the way to go and and not necessarily focused on the dashboarding side as much about company sales engineer so we have large customers that use the tool is very complementary and its kinda that best of breed do your dashboarding true traditional stuff and third party vendor third party vendor and then for the ad hoc you company yeah and okaynameremoved   removed search types name hi this is name might might it also be the case that for those for those other search features and those other tools the scope of that search is going to be limited to whats been designed and built within that specific application so like in the case of third party vendor it would be presumably im just guessing searching all the stuff thats been built in third party vendor not in the underlying data stores and data with third party vendor i assume right,0.993,0.144,0.02,0.836
high,won,company product,sales engineer yeah thats something that weve weve heard from customers and then with with both those tools theres a lot of pre work required on the data side in terms of aggregations and not necessarily first class live connections back to things like third party vendorname  okay that makes sense okay yeah questionsales engineer data management  functions name hi this is marriage longer just a quick question on that underlying data structure then i was gonna hold it for a while until you get through here but you brought up the star schemer or what looked like a star scheme on before you dont have to navigate back to it im curious about the amount of data prop that would need to be done to get data into a format so that the tool can sit on it easilysales engineer yeah good good question so company requires relational data but we want the most granular version of that relational data data architecture sales engineer so were pretty scheme agnostic in terms of it could be a star itll be a third party vendor it could be a d normalize table its all a live connection back toremoved   removedthird party vendor sorry in terms of query performance scale all of that stuff company its just generating sequel thats being sent to that platform data management  functions sales engineer so if we say hey maybe id normalized tables performed better in some situations maybe a third party vendor schemer and perform better and other situations were pretty agnostic there its more best practices on the third party vendor side in that case but that is really the main data prep obviously those data cleansing problems we dont want the same name the removed spelled  different ways thats not a company thing right but thats thats the main pieces that needs to be relational but then we want the most granular version of thatname data okay so as long as the relationships exist between the different tables then thats thats good enough or thatsales engineer yeah and you can define them an company as well so were not its not a requirement that you have to define your keys and relationships on the third party vendor side if they are to find their company inherits them thats great but if not you can you can do it easily within the company you as well okay awesome thanks data architecture nameclient when you say like a live connection to the third party vendor data right because i think about your your presumably grabbing some big everything data set and then holding in memory right because no were not actuallysales engineerclient okay so i think about third party vendor every time i run a query you know on like a reasonably large set of data that we have right data architecture ends removed   removedclient its its like you know a minute and a half or something to return a new ones like every time i type in a keyword like how does it stop it from having to wait that longsales engineer and trust and when you talk about large data sets what just to give us a sense of the volume what whats like a common row count yeah so the,0.9991,0.229,0.017,0.755
high,won,pricing,clientclientclient the example i was thinking of there might be some other optimization but were talking about a claims data set so its like removed and you know its like  columns or somethinggotcha soaccount executive whats the other customers that we work data architecture sales engineersales engineerwith were doing things in the tens removed on third party vendor and it really comes down to size and your warehouse appropriately on the third party vendor side okayclientsales engineer so we have i mean we have common things like with removed or most common data sets about removed were on a large warehouse in that case who name orremoved   removedin the tens of billions were on it to excel removed or in a couple of removed and its on the medium warehouse so its kind of the beauty of third party vendor is that it it cant scale and as long as we get that right then the company experience is going to beclient okay so it seems like theres theres a couple of like a few seconds maybe like five seconds sometimes its just like spin up time right and for the queries is that do you guys face that too is there any you guys adrian kind of optimization to keep that from happening or anything like that that comes down toaccount executivesales engineer the third party vendor configuration and the auto suspend blank so i mean some customers have a very small auto suspend where it says hey if we dont use this whereas  seconds then spend it down and in that case yeah you do have to wait sometimes for the warehouse to turn on for other customers its more common to do five to  minutes so its not i mean its it comes back to how often its really being used got it so yeah its interesting theseaccount executiveclient too many questions for the for for it actually sending the query back to third party vendor does it do it as you type each selection in your search bar or does it wait a few seconds and then often does it send a query back to third party vendor,0.9971,0.188,0.014,0.797
high,won,demo,sales engineer  yeah let me pull up a different instance xaccount executive hellosales engineer thats actually a a search or a go button client who asked i thinkclientremoved   removed yes thank yousales engineer yeah so as you search lets see theres this go button here so if i say sales weekly or next day state nothing happens until actually hit go and its at that point that a query i sent her third party vendor,0.8834,0.166,0.0,0.834
high,won,company product,client okay okay i had missed that it too thanksnamealways a live connection right im assuming with the databaseyeahsales engineernameand then whatever dashboard we are making using this analysis or we like theres no point off plenty to you flush out anything right because of static so id be saving their dashboard somewhere or is it just for explorationsales engineer no so if i jump back here along the way i saved a few of my analysis that i found that i created this prompt to dashboard so this is how you would save your searches or save your dashboards everything here is a live connection so i just pulled up this dashboard its sent queries to third party vendor to grab the latest data so theres no refresh schedule its always grabbing the latest data and then if i want to share it out with user as i say hey i want to share it out with this business user they can either edit it or view it depending on security requirements teams et cetera data architecture sales engineer and then again when they pull it up its just a new query to snuff like if the data is cached and third party vendor which it often is if the data hasnt changed then itll just hit that cash and i wont use new third party vendor resources flight youre always grabbing the whatever is the latest and stuff like data management  functions removed   removedname so is it a prerequisite to always have a relational model behind needs toclientsales engineer be relational data so columns and rows in terms of the model itself as long as there are relationships between the data that you want to search across thats thats really all you need that might make sense for me to shift gears and walkthrough what that looks like data drill down client okay do you make a new query when you as youre just as youre skipping over do you make a new query when you drill down or is that like youre pulling those granular data so you dont need to keep askingsales engineer it is a new query so like this where were at the weekly level so if i drill down here it only return the weekly data and if i want to drill down by each group thats a new query for that specific weekclientthe exact data thats being shown is whats being pulledsales engineeryeah exactlyclientso how your fan to look different they use a like a different access data architecture clientpeople maybe in different departments have different access so client is search your search of data its like a query from the database side all pass the parameter to query send it to a databasesales engineerremoved   removed yeah did depending on how your third party vendor is setup we can authenticate a couple of ways and we can actually hit on that as i as i go through there so im actually going to walkthrough adding a connection and two data architecture ends account executivesales engineer or im not sure who asked that question but theres two ways we can authenticate the third party vendor so one which ill be for the demo here is using a service account so in this case its a typical service count that you would see another bi applications and as users are accessing data its using these credentials now you can apply security on top of that if you wanted to find row and column level security within company as well as object level security so does someone have access to a dashboard thats built off of this do they have access to this data et cetera the other way is using off and pass through security so if you have roles and security defined for each user in third party vendor then you can set it up to use a loss and then when each person logged into company its passing through their third party vendor credentials and so its respecting any security thats been defined at the third party vendor laterclient okay second your controller security and our base site in the third party vendorsales engineer thats one option yeah so you can do it there or you can do it all at the company layersales engineer so what im gonna do here is this is really defining the scope of what i want to make available to be searched in company data management  functions sales engineer so we have a pretty simple schemer here one fact to dimension tables im just hitting the check box because i know i wanna use all these fields in here and when i create the connection company not moving the data so again were not moving in the in memory and the company company simply go into third party vendor looking to see if the relationships are already defined on the third party vendor side in terms of any primary foreign key constraints and were creating that connection to third party vendor here as you can see it says hey weve made the connection you canremoved   removedjust search now and i can say yeah i want to search now but as you can see on the left here its still database so we started facts dimensions if still three separate objects for each table and as an technical user this is still not quite what i mean i want just that single clean entity like we saw earlier in the demo and thats where the final layer of creation comes into play im gonna tag these just to make them a little bit easier to find formation so this is a demo system and you can see here we can see it says joints to this is because in our case the relationships were already defined on the third party vendor side thats so company found them that hey we see that product that would be related to product id we could always add a joined condition if we needed to as well if it wasnt defined in third party vendor or if we need to add some other logic but from here were going to build the worksheet so we have those three tables and i know i want to grab fields from each of these three tables data management  functions ends sales engineer so well come in here and check the box on those and im an admin on this demo system says content and heres where i can choose exactly what columns are going to be exposed so maybe product id is not something that the end users need access to so ill just choose product name product type im gonna keep this pretty simple here for the sake of time well say grab sales grab data so you can see on the left here originally and my table we had   fields and we wanna make it simple and consumable for end users so im just gonna choose to expose the six fields now if we need to add something that wasnt necessaccount executively defined in third party vendor simple profit example we could come in here and create our own logic for sales minus item price and then to an end user thats going to be exposed so its going to appear just like any field so ill save this here call it our prompt worksheet and really the finalaccount executiveclientsales engineer layer of curation here is just making them more consumable for the business so you can see we still have those original column names will rename things im not gonna go through all of these here but what the column names just as important is this concept of synonyms and this is where we can define how do we allow a user to ask the same question using five different terms so in this case its retail data maybe people also called product name item or prod name or product or skew so this curation process allows the user to then when they go to search they can ask the same question in five  different ways based on the synonyms that have been curated course theres other things like data types choosing your default number formats all that stuff butremoved   removed from here the theaccount executivesales engineer final steps would be applying any security that needs to be applied in terms of pro column level and then sharing with the appropriate user base so in production youre going to have multiple worksheets depending on different subject areas different groups and and well say hey this credit card group they should be the ones that have access to this dataset and they can begin searching once i share it out agenda sales engineer really were back at a similar points where we work here where itll help you that clean single thing on the left and they can begin asking questions like i had done in the front part of the demo im gonna pause here got about  minutes left so really any questions or areas you guys want to go deeper on agenda ends client data drill down client the things that i was interested in from an end user capabilities perspective was being able to not only you know drill down different ways that are interesting for the end users purposes but once you get down to a data set that you are interested in then you can add in additional fields at that point which is very different from a lot of our other tools usually you have to predefine that or you have to have a data set thats you know all inclusive and also you probably most of the time except for some of the honda tools that we had previously you have to define everything ahead of time so could you show them like maybe an example of drilling down and then getting to a point to where you have the data set that you think you need but then youre able to add in other fields that would support that dataset yeah data drill down ends sales engineer yeah sure so we have a search like this just go link the stay by specialty here so lets say i want to drill down on gastro here yeah we want to look at it by patient name or even if were here we wanna first drill to the practitioner and thenremoved   removedlets say we want to drill in on this particular practitioner rose to the h group of our removed data drill down sales engineer and then i want to drill here to the patient name so at this point weve drilled the something fairly granular to mass where we have this list of  unique removed but now i want to add that additional context so i could come over here and say i want to add their gender on add their employment status i want to add what outstanding tests they had what their pre release risk was so we can add this context and then you can also shift the contacts however you want so we could say hey this is interesting but instead of this stage group i wanna look at my  to  each group so you can really pivot however you want once youre out that that granular point data management  functions name my two are you asking this what are what are you asking of the column is not even available on the left hand side or join he made with those three tables if its there and the four tables what will happen then what are you asking that already were asking just on the left hand side delivered by that particular column which was not there beforeclient i think hes demonstrating what i was asking about you ask another good question i mean i dont think soname something like we gave part spar these to whatever the fact them dimension tables and its bringing from that tonight name my customer comes in he set forth field which is not even in these three tables data management  functions ends name then we need to go back our that again so basically what we are trying to do here also we are trying to make another small model here tonight which we think about customer might like and then by joining those four or five tables we are answering questions different questions dynamic oceans using that particular model or under only and we are still supplying that new model its not like im saying like hey go to my cdw and its open right sorry go to my third party vendor or just open and this is my question im still trying to bring a subset model out thereremoved   removedsales engineer  yeah yeah thats a fair statement industry issues sales engineer youre still defining scope through this semantic layer in company and the whole point is create the worksheet or the semantic layer and company do that upfront and that then opens a search wherenamesales engineer a user can ask a  questions compared too spending all that time building a dashboard that may answer   questions industry issues ends name you know kind of extending that particular part of that i just brought up im curious if that is a capability in company there once you have greater down to a certain level and lets say you have all those removed name is it possible to automatically pass thats just astronomical into another data set where you can probably put something completely different like for example medication for expertise on im on im on vacation and is it possible to some other modelssales engineer so meaning if we can be this point have these  removed could we grab these values and pass them somewhere else my hearing right yeahnamesales engineer got it yeah theres a couple of ways you could do that i mean you could simply say i want to grab these removed copy them out and then if we had a even a different data source but it had patient name we could come in here say i wanna apply a filter at our values paste them in so that would just allow you to quickly grab that subset throw it in something else we also have some pretty cool stuff coming in our roadmap allowing you to push these things to other applications so if you said hey theres a really interesting subset of removed i want to pass it toremoved   removedwhatever some system that has an api that would also be a custom thing where you could say hey there could be another option here that says send this data to x and it could pass the data programmatically so so a couple of ways that you could do that there okaynameclient yeah it might be nice to have an option in there too you know at a you know cross over to another data model then company like you could have the output of one data model be the input of another one or somethingsales engineer  what would be an example that mapclient what kind of where you get down to a data set for one purpose but then you want to know more revenue data about you know the impact of this particular area so then youd want to take that patient population or visits or whatever they are and time and if theres a way to tied into the other data set then you could you know just daisy chain datasetsclient so you can imagine like so imagine like data sets that dont that i have like a like have a many to many situation like so like imagine like hostile encounters and sorry about the screen and labs right and so like youd be like hey so lets talk about all the removed who had a longer than expected like this day and like what kind of labs that have been having not necessarily during that encounter id be like what other kind of lives i mean is there anything thats like similar in their labs right and so youre like is this hinge have a patient but like youre talking about very different data models and it almost certainly be different worksheets yeah data management  functions sales engineer things that we do in terms of of modeling this where you can use multiple fact tables the common the remove create a space like on the payroll side of common one is i want to fact tables claims that one fact table of calls that they were inbound to our system as long as there is some short of shared dimension or a set of shared dimension models you could create a search experience that allows people to go cross domain like that so thats something certainly thats possible obviously you gotta be cognizant of the data model and the many too manyremoved   removed data management  functions ends sales engineer so people dont get wrong answers but certainly a common use case to go multi fact like like youre logged into their trust themclient this has been i have a question like in terms of creating a new field lets say there is a you want to create a new column that does not exist on the left but the in order to create a new field that you need to utilize like a multiple fields on the left what together was a formula or something at the end of the output of this new field its a yes or no would you be able to to do it heresales engineer yeah so would it be like for example if the gender is female and outstanding test is yes then defined it as x that type of thing right rightclientsales engineer yeah you you can absolutely do that so you can add a formula here you can see theres all the the typical functions and aggregations and operations so you could absolutely say hey if gender equals female hellonamesales engineer and outstanding tasks equals yes and equal sign and submit an ex else why so short answer yes long answer thats thats a quick example of how it would be doneclient another question was that from last meeting that the and also on your documents via were seeing that the the data you you go to third party vendor and then the index are stored in memory in company data architecture clientremoved   removed is that still the case because i heard earlier that the youre saying theres no data being stored in company its all live connectionso in terms ofqueriesclientaccount executivesales engineerthemselves those are all live connection so this entire results set that was a live query sent to third party vendor the only thing thats stored on the company side is this search index so when i go to type in lets see when i go to type in thl and this thompson memorial instantly pops up as a suggestion data architecture ends sales engineer this was the search index that was built in company and so for each field it has the unique values stored in the company search index and its purely for the purpose of this search suggestion when someone types in and it does the auto complete and thats something you can configure on a column by column basis and then how often those indexes are refreshed search types nameclient so what kinds of index are these are these the an lp kinds of index or this is some other kinds of index thats being storedsales engineer in terms of like the technology that its actuallyclient what what kinds of technology is behind those indexsales engineerremoved   removed gotcha i dont i dont have the technical details of of what the actual technology is its something that our founders built they were at third party vendor before coming over to company so a comclientation of of what they built based on that but its not like a database index its something that stores these these values but we can get details,0.9999,0.149,0.012,0.839
high,won,deployment options,name exactly what that entails from a technical standpointclient yeah so related to index so these if the index contents the sensitive data like a phr the but thats actually stored in company how are we gonna is there a way we can protect thatsales engineer yeah theres theres multiple things there so for one theres different deployment models of company so theres i fully hosted managed version of company company cloud but then theres company software you guys can deploy within your walls so no data leaves the client environment so it can be deployed in your as your environment private network for example deployment options ends sales engineer and then on the company side regardless of where its deployed you can control exactly what is being index so patient name for example would be something that most likely would not be indexed unless you want to allow users to to search on it and the suggestions all respect each individual persons role so theres a combination of things that can be implemented there and then depending on where i company us deployed it can definitely be done in a secure manner and thats exactly what we do for all our other remove customersokay thanksclientsales engineernow weve got about three minutes left are you wanna drinkaccount executiveyeah yeah interesting did you have one more quick question before weremoved   removedclient hi name i think the opposite of what name was asking about like you know defining logic and that kind of stuff on this because i want to do the opposite i want to like import as much logic from a central repository,0.985,0.138,0.013,0.849
high,won,company product,client instead its like what are the options you talked about primary key foreign key defined in third party vendor what are the options for importing other things about like relationships and meditate and that kind of stuff that were doing as little as possible here slit everythings like shared between systemssales engineerhello whats what are other things that you would want to import name data management  functions ends client so extending them to be a good examplesales engineergotcha and where what system do you have those in todayclientso like an enterprise data catalogue be where would that would be like i think its x i excellent is were what were using gotcha so hellosales engineerclientsales engineer find the right tab here so theres not a native just one click integration with those other tools we have integrations coming with data catalogs all of these data models and samantha players are all some called company model and language so this can be programmatically done where it can be integrated with those tools assuming they have api to pull something like a sending them a little bit more custom work today and then in the future ill be more seamless just the rest ofremoved   removedclient yeah well it doesnt look too bad yeah okayyeah it is city yeahsales engineeraccount executiveperfect thanks sales engineer so i know were just about at the end the end of our session here today i will follow up so that everyone has my contact info,0.9854,0.151,0.011,0.838

here and i own this removed i manageremoved  removedmost or im the program owner of our data warehouse solution for the company so our enterprise data warehousing solution i also am in charge of our erp system our procurement system and a whole bunch of other applications were very small it organization for a relatively bigger company in terms of it to the rest of the company and so i think its a total of  people in the it department for  person company customer base ends client so we were a lot of hats we i honest removed for the last  years has been a a rare drug sees research facility and so theyve tried to find its just a bunch of ph d scientists that tried to find the drugs that help ultra rare disease is so maybe a disease that impacts a removed people in the world you know so very small markets but huge impact this year the company bought a commercial entity so they want to be whats considered a fifth co a fully integrated removed commercial organization and so that means were gonna make the drugs and were going to sell it and so with selling the drugs comes a whole bunch of new requirements reporting requirements additional warehousing and then you know were trying to work out all the entry points all the io to our data warehouse so import inputs and outputs right now our output for an enterprise visualization tool is third party vendor thats not going away our our executive director is a huge removed guy,0.9997,0.235,0.027,0.738
high,won,company product,client so were on the full removed stack as your back end and then you know as your sql server database which may be moving being completely ported over to third party vendor so were kind of struggling both at the moment a sequel server as your sql server and third party vendor and we recently got a request from one of the field medical directors which is somebody that you know talk to the doctors and stuff like that might be a fancier term for account executive im not sure you know each company kind of labels that position a little differently and so he said i want to write sequel against your database against the data and were like you know youre youre an account executive im sure you have really good sequel chops im sure data architecture ends client like you know you could dig in and figure it out however is that where your time is best spent right does that add value to you selling the product to this doctor you know it really doesnt that takes them away from doing this core job right like being able by he like hes like now you know i think i i i think me and the team really want to write sequel and were like i dont think so data architecture removed  removedclient and so thats where company kind of came from and so i downloaded the free trial and were able to make those connections ive connected in the third party vendor but now i like i said my executive director is a huge removedguy search types client so third party vendor actually has a comparable tool to company right in the application its an add on right in third party vendor and it allows you to write plain english sequel if you will or plain english syntax where its like return you know this value using you know the damn employee or the them whatever and it just returns it data management  functions client but when we are looking at that you know that kind of makes assumptions based on the model so that assumes the job it knows the joins already and and thats kind of not what were looking for because he wants to they want the ability to to slice and dice i hate those i just hate that term but slice and dice the data you data management  functions ends account executiveclient know with different joins looking at different granularity you know type of things like that so thats currently where were at and im kind of setting the stage for you guys to help me get over that third party vendor home because that is going to be a challenge for us by so that my boss he really wants to use company data architecture client hes hes all in on third party vendor hes trying to you know get get everything moved over to third party vendor and so you know company is what third party vendor uses at their company for this particular type of thing and so thats how you guys were recommended and so itll be a little bit of a challenge data architecture ends removed  removedclient we we do have our work cut out for us but you know weve shown company to that team they really like it my boss likes it and so you know thats where were at and ill let you guys kinda direct the conversation from here at this pointaccount executive yeah well thanks client that was a great overview it gives a lot more context of kind of current state and where youre looking to go on familiaccount executivety with company few followed by questions i have from what you just went over because i think were company really plays into the mix for one with almost every single customer that we have,0.9966,0.146,0.037,0.816
high,won,about company,account executive its a complimentary tool its very rare that will just come in and its like now all of our reporting and data visualizations and add hawk analysis is through company we have seen that with some newer organizations that we call kind of like digital natives where theyre like in the cloud and they just want to answer questions and dont have some of the traditional reporting historically industry issues account executive but really most of the organizations enterprise organizations that we support its either third party vendor or third party vendor and then company and it really depends on like the use case and the value add of what youre looking to get out of the tool it seems like youve already done a good amount of research and obviously with the free trial but its really in that selfservice being able to ask questions quickly and we have like battle cards of okay third party vendor is kind of search versus versus company search types account executive one of the main difference differences is like we came into the market with the purpose of search our founders came from search backgrounds and we built the tool to solve that problem of business users not being able to to get the data insights that they need search types ends account executive and a lot of i would say the more traditional reporting tools kind of have it as an add on and thats what it is in some cases that serves a purpose some cases itremoved  removedreally does it so when you guys are talking about selfservice it sounds like this use case for the account executive sales is that the main when youre is that what started this conversation or have you guys been having a little bit of a gap with selfservice before this account exit executive wanted to write sequel on your data warehouseclient yeah so currently today no citizen developers you know no one out there thats outside of the it department kind of munching through this data but you did bring up a good point and something that i want to highlight is through this process will need to define the clear delineation of when to use third party vendor when to drop to company you know and be able to articulate that like these are like we try we we have to try to really remove the ambiguity and the reason i say that is my executive director is going to pull calls and all that ambiguity and so we just need to have like you know third party vendor serves this function company search this so if you need to do this use company type of dealaccount executive yeah and we work through that really with any customer that we engage with and obviously tailor it to what actually brings value to you guys and what youre thinking for use cases okay and then im just curious so you said  people in it and then you said  employees thats correct about company clientaccount executive my gosh so how how is how is that in terms of like if someone hasnt request you get a lot of requests for reporting and analytics like what does that process phone what isclient yeah so we this is like a  year old startup company theres really not an enter a lot of enterprise grade processes put in place ive only been here for a year and ive come from a much larger company called decks calm about company ends  yeah im familiar with xaccount executiveclientremoved  removed yeah so there is like a lot of enterprise grade processes put in place and you know but were trying to implement that here but the current kind have evolution number request goes something like i need this done im im going to send a mass email out to the it department customer base client and then whoever responds to me is kind of the person that potentially owns it because they responded yeah and so thats kind of like where were at but weve been working closely with the commercial side of things because we bought a commercial entity and were trying to implement it into our current ecosystem data management  functions client and so theres a lot of theres gonna be a lot of data down the pipeline and so when i say like a lot of data you know prescribers any kinds of bioremoved core data sets that you guys hi guys can think of that other customers use us probably were going to be buying like you know prescriber data medical facility data data management  functions ends client were going to be getting our removed data returned to us through potentially i cube via or something like that and then we have our you know a whole bunch of other data on ray or diseases all the kinds of chemistry that goes into rare diseases more goes into the drug because they want to be able too have those kinds of deep dive technical conversation with the doctors and kind of look at the data differently in real time and thats where thats why company is kind of like perfect for that because it enables you to do that and so thats kind of how request flow in today its not really theres really no method to the madness at the momentsales engineer and how long does it take to usually turn that around you know typicallyclient so i have a so i you know i from my core functions like procurement accounting finance i have a managed service team that helps me with tasks for the for the data warehousing development i you know it so i right you know the tables views store procedures triggers whatever the heck and then we have a guy that does the visualization and so those requests are thats where we tackled like enterprise grade stuff first and so theres a pretty good processremoved  removed theyresales engineerclient still ironing out some kinks but the turnaround is weeks maybe months because its me right so they they have they have no choice but the way to when i can get to itaccount executive okay so what what do you think would be a good next step because it sounds like you have a good understanding of kind of our value prop where we could potentially fit into this use case the ecosystem what do you need from us right nowclient i think let me just share my screen real quick and ill answer that question so here i am see if i can remember thisclient good hes the same password for everything alright so i dont know really how did i set up some stuff okay so i guess heres my worksheet,0.9995,0.163,0.024,0.814
high,won,company product,client i dont know how i got there though heres the tables i put it in so i loaded some data from third party vendor or here we go connections so i made a generic third party vendor connection but i guess i needed to depending on which data sources i brought in would have a date so each data source maybe as a different connection but i was able to get all that setup and so these are kind of just like maybe the tables we want to look at it may not be but i think the next step for us would be maybe kind of cleaning this up with me telling me best practices how to like navigate through this ui kinds of making it look you know presentable data management  functions ends client and then that could maybe be like a  minute with client and sales engineer just get this cleaned up make it look nice maybe add some additional data sources in show me how its being used today for other customers show me some maybe other things and then after that call once its kind of like you know a better state then i have it here because you feel like its all you know capitals lower case mixed case camel case once we get there well bring in that the field medical director and my hi boss because hes interested and well bring in the field merge field medicalremoved  removeddirector to kind of talk us through what he hope to achieve with this tool but the the current understanding is is he wants to kind of have something where i dont know how to get back there data management  functions client okay here he wants to kinda do stuff like this you know i dont know if this is gonna do anything but you know bring in data sources join them up i forget where the joins where but he he may want to do different joins and stuff like that data management  functions ends client so i dont know if theres a concept of like a data catalogue in here or something that we can put some sort of descript or next to the column name like you know for joined this to this because its just never gonna work for you type of deal and then also the one big thing that i hope to come out of all this is we get it to a state that intuitive right to where i dont have to constantly answer questions like i dont want this to be another kind have  percent of my day job this should this should help me to unload some of the request i get not add additional work for me so i think those would be next steps but im open to whatever you guys suggest as well this is this were gonna want to kind of move a little quick on this too just because were competing with the third party vendor thing which is already available in our environment today about company client so were were not really against time but you know if people are like the third party vendor things here its in production its working you know what the heck do i need to go to this company meeting for you know industry issues client and thats a harder answer thats a harder question for me to answer at that point because what do i say right like its gonna provide you know two percent more free time for you and they might be like thats really not a value add so the sooner the better this is my calendar this week,0.9984,0.164,0.012,0.824
high,won,agenda,clientremoved  removed so wherever your i can send a screenshot of this and then you guys can fill in times and the gap in the gaps here too you know talk about those next steps or start diving deepaccount executive yeah yeah i think it sounds like first next step lets schedule some time so we can work through some of these technical aspects with you to get the data clean and i mean have you i dont know if this would be helpful client sales engineer let me know your thoughts but sometimes when you first at least like have you seen a demo like we could demo like this is like the best way to utilize company and then lets set up your environment to be able to to do that,0.9768,0.198,0.0,0.802
high,won,onboarding,account executive so its not as much of that i click here i dont really know what im doing like obviously the enablement and training its pretty quick and easy because its intuitive to use but at the same time its helpful and youve only seen like how its best utilize yeah agenda client set that up for like an hour in the first  can be like the demo and then last  can be the clean up be greataccount executive yeah i think that would be good and then next step from there it sounds like youll socialize it a bit internally but were more than happy to jump on a call or a meeting with a wider audience and also even kind of go through like this is company this is the problem we solve these are similar customers weve supported here lets do a demo and this is actually the demo that client put together from some of your third party vendor data like we can work with you on whatever you need from us to help and socializing thatclient  great yeah that sounds great yeahsales engineer,0.9974,0.332,0.015,0.654
high,won,company product,removed  removedsales engineer one question on the data pieces most of the data that you know you you guys leverage for those request in third party vendor or is it a variety of sources todayclient it will it will most likely be in third party vendor for this but if we can also kind of if we can also bring in some as your data and join that somehow to the third party vendor data that would be you know it might get some whos in us type of deal so data architecture ends sales engineer gotcha gotcha and what actual i saw there was some like the inventory and you know things on the cost side for maybe the raw materials for the drugs is is that you know one source thats in third party vendor already and then yeah so give me a feel for like what i guess items or questions you would look to ask with different data as wellclient yeah so a lot of it is going to be around like a doctors prescriclientg patterns you know and then its gonna drop down into like this doctor prescribes this these where diseases in based on you know other doctors that prescribed these where diseases they may also prescribe for this rare disease type of thing so its like you know when youre dealing with a  removed and the world you gotta like really find those needles in the haystack like which where these patient whos which doctors are these removed too right and so they want to kind of have you know maybe reverse engineer into that into that answer and so that theres questions like that and then you know sales type data questions you know i dont know ill get some ill get a list of questions this afternoon and shoot it over to you guys yeah may wanna try to answer but the thing is is not all that data is currently in third party vendor so like were trying to were were working on all those contracts to go and buy stuff like that so sure that at least that data is in third party vendor today that i was showing yousales engineer cool yeah be helpful is if you have some of those questions and definitely can use that as a starting point agenda sales engineer and i think account executivewe were talking about before you know some of similar customers that you know might leverage company in similar ways like just broadly the their use cases and we can see if any of those resonate you know in theremoved  removeddemo portion and then walkthrough those best practices and make sure your setup to present to you know your team on what you built you know throughout the trial definitely sounds good agenda ends clientaccount executive helpful to get the questions also in in client will walkthrough this with you but theres a portion of it where you include the synonyms of like what would someone normally search and so thats something to make sure its set up properly where the type of language someone would use to look for something you knowclient thats actually a really thats a really cool feature i didnt know what the synonyms thing yeahaccount executiveclient because you you know these people are all phds or their actual medical doctors like these account executives and so they all you know call something the same thing something differentaccount executive yeah yeah like i mean i also this is totally not related industry wise but i also support julios they work with us quite a bit and like removed video on demand they all use like s bought so like its part of like sending them so if theyre looking like s vibe like original programming versus different types of content so its just good to start thinking through that and then yeah i mean i feel like just at least in this initial intro and some of the questions that youre looking to ask it plays and really well to our sweet spot of like driving into the granularity of the data were were connected directly to your cloud warehouse so really anything in there someone could get to that granular level of looking okay doctors prescribed to these removed so lets get a list of those removed or wherever these removed located like asking those questions it sounds like its a use case where theres a lot of different questions that come up agenda account executiveremoved  removed and that bird i would say where we differentiate so as we go along that path more of the the third party vendor feature versus company i think itll be pretty clear once we get more to that so if you could send us that screenshot of your calendar ill work with sales engineer in in client and try to block out an hour if that works for you so we could do a demo and then that will i think guide the conversation well okay lets get your environment set up to have the similar type of experienceclient great yeah and if you guys if you guys wanted to do that tomorrow morning at some point that would that would be great because i have to kinda given update by one  on where im at with all this company stuff although its not,0.9996,0.214,0.014,0.772

high,won,about company,clientaccount executive just a bit about about us and im im sure client i understand client is is investing a lot in in third party vendor and and what weve seen our customers is large investments towards transforming their data from our insights im looking for ways to be able to unlock more value tell a story with the data really viewing their data as a priority asset in competitive edge data architecture account executive and so how company fits into this modern data stack is think of us as like a modern front end to your cloud data warehouse like a third party vendor and we help and driving business value out of that by making it very easy for any type of user to be able to create their own data insights and really be able to drive analytics to a larger community base search types account executive so company is all about accessibility of data for any user regardless of their sequel skill set and what youll see out the demo thats unique about our technology is natural language search so we find a lot of business users sometimes just needing a an answer to a question not always meeting have a full blown pixel perfect visualization so how we solve for that is similar to how you would third party vendor something in your personal life being able to really apply that to your business data and then that paired with ai driven insights and what we mean by that youll see it too easy in the platform so the first one is the the platform is built with ai so its more personalized for each user based off of what theyve searched on and the content that they have looked at in the past and then theres also an ability through what we call company product to help better explain the why behind the data and thats like a differentremoved   removedautomated trends correlations outliers things like that where you could put the platform to work to do some more of that analysis about company account executive and as you can see created for really enterprise organizations we work with some of the largest companies across all industries obviously as i mentioned you lose the customer we connect to like over removed rows of their third party vendor data for subscriber in in content  use cases and then in this ecosystem you know gartner has us as a visionary the last few years and analytics were coming in and this this kind of new wave of augmented analytics and strong partnership across all of the cloud providers specific to third party vendor as i know majority sounds like almost all of your data isnt third party vendor theyve actually invested in company as a part of their venture portfolio data architecture account executive are theyre a customer to company so theyre cio brought in company and as part of their analytics architecture for a lot of their it sm data and then theyre expanding use cases into sales and then client will show this but the the purposely built connector so i think it was try who maybe had asked about kind of the data connection and governance so well make sure to hit on that in the demo but were continually investing in our partnership with with third party vendor and we have hundreds of joint customers working specifically on that that live connect to third party vendor and then you know with this what youll see is is is our goal in our platform is to build a really interactive data experience for any type of user about company account executive so a lot of the organizations we support were across several lines of business and all of them have existing tools like a third party vendor or a third party vendor some are even consolidating like reasons large customer theyre going from like  different looks tools to to for enterprise and instill brought in company to be an enterprise tool and its really and how we how we complement some of those other tools industry issues account executive and then also how we differentiate so few key things that our customers see value in and why they brought in company ease of use or search so toilets into different business users the sequel is automated so it helps to address a challenge for users who are not technical to be able to get some of their questions answered themselves and and with that the use cases that are really great for us is whenremoved   removedtheres a lot of add hawk questions and theres large complex data sets and i really like to emphasize the importance of granularty of the data for decision making and so what i mean by that is since we connect live to third party vendor and with our power platforms architected you do not need to predefine every single drill path that you think the user might ask a question of so enables the user to really take the question where they want to go into data that they have access to and a governance secure way to really be able to get to like a decision making great and the data will show this throughout the demo but whether thats getting to the customer idea the skew level transaction id for who lou a lot of the users are our content analysts subscription analyst marketing finance product managers who dont know sql and they have other tools that they have access to use cases account executive but theyll jump into company to be able to answer a lot of their add hawk questions around you know for subscriber data like billing platform cancel request states gender marketing campaigns understanding the zip codes for subscription but you know the partner the partner type the channel the different measures like active unique subscribers things like that industry issues account executive and we can always do a session to dive deeper into that but being able to have a platform to just jump into that and get their own answered and with that theres really like kind of two key key things for for users not needing to solely solely rely on data teams so that creates a lot of time savings and productivity it eliminates that like back and forth of some of the manual work of someone gets a dashboard that drive several new questions it might even think of a whole new train of thought of a question that they want to go down and maybe that wasnt pre defined in the the dashboard so instead of having to go back and forth through the data teams then being able to jump in and just kinda get that answered themselves and then that enables quicker time to insights being able them to make more data driven decisions real time in that moment versus needing to wait search types account executive and then this is my last slide just to highlight a few things that youll see throughout the demo that differentiate company so again user experience which ultimately drive adoption a lot of users have that familiarity with search from our personal lives and then the query engine like this is the heart of our platform data architecture account executiveremoved   removed so it it creates complex sequel queries at scale but the beauty of all of that is a user does not need a new sequel all of thats automated and then the flexibility and how this is consume so were were were born in the browser you do not need to move your data we connect live to third party vendor as i mentioned so its its governance secure there so anything that youre doing within third party vendor like we inherit that and that also as i mentioned enables that granularity for the user to get to that decision making great and the data in the platform versus weve seen a lot of customers before company have challenges with like my gosh my users just ask for data dumps or they put everything into excel to get to that granular level that they couldnt get to in the dashboard data architecture ends account executive so company keeps it more contained within our pop because we enable that granularity and then i do like to mentioned because im not sure all the use cases you guys have in mind but this is ive been talking about enterprise analytics this can also be embedded so we have a lot of interesting use cases where thats whether its an internal data portal internal applications or external which i dont think that fully applies to your guys this team but you know like removed embed company in their supplier portal for payments data we have some telecommunication companies who embed it for like their billing information so we have another platform or within company everywhere a whole developer playground where theres a lot of flexibility with embedding this so ill stop sharing and switch it to client but before i do that any like questions or thoughts just based off of what i i hit on at a high level,0.9996,0.138,0.01,0.853
high,won,agenda,client i have a couple of technical questions but i feel like they might get answered so im just gonna wait yeah same hereclientaccount executive okay yeah im sure a lot of technical questions will come up as you see it so i will ill pass it to client on that one because he is best to answer that as well agenda sales engineer awesome yeah thanks account executive thats thats great i think context to set before the demo and really account executive s actually pretty similar to how who lou use this company today with their subscriber  analysis and again think of me as a business user someone thats kind of non technical for this first part,0.9916,0.305,0.028,0.667
high,won,company product,sales engineer i like to start in familiar place for most folks have a dashboard right company actually calls this a live board and most bi tools a static dashboard thats often the endpoint for a business user right the end of the road in company are liveremoved   removedboards are instead meant to be a jumping off point and every question that you ask within a live board is sending a live query down to third party vendor underneath the hood so if i want to explore you know this this existing dashboard live board more fully by user can hop into an existing answer here and theres no dead end data drill down sales engineer i can apply my own filters i can say maybe i just wanna look at just the last six months of my subscriber data right i can slice this is slightly slightly different way if i wanna look at this instead of by gender maybe a different attribute would be age group and i can apply that really easily on the fly without having to you know pick through a filter menu or bother the data teams to make that change for me right and then within the visualizations themselves theres you know a lot of flexibility to investigate further so if i see this spike within you know this particular cohort i wanna see you know maybe what shows where they watching thats industry issues sales engineer a question that wherever traditionally sets up dashboards maybe they didnt think of that exact hierarchy or maybe they had the cube or aggregate or extract the data so that you lost that level of granularity within the within the dashboard within company theres a lot of selfservice even on these prebuilt visualizations that users can leverage as a starting point right search types sales engineer and i mentioned this this is just kind of a familiar place right to most folks to kind of anchor what company is where it plays yes we can build dashboards right as an analytics tool thats absolutely something we can do but really the next all of selfservice that we enabled its rather unique to our platform is the ability to search directly against my data so account executive hit on it before but you can think of company kind of in a sense as an answer engine right its sitting on top of third party vendor allowing people that dont know sequel to easily ask questions just like they were in their personal lives so lets say i want to ask the question that wasnt pre baked into that initial dashboard right data drill down sales engineer maybe something around our number of customers that have signed up on a weekly basis customer start date over the last maybe lets say  months and then youll see company is you know understanding the terms that im typing and then its mending and making me select you know what i actually meanremoved   removed search types sales engineer if theres any you know to december you wait those terms and then maybe ill slice this by customer region as i type that search what company is doing here its translating that natural language question bit of business user you know comfortably rights just in the same way that they would search for you know blue shoes on third party vendor right data architecture sales engineer they would use those search tokens im just you know like they were in their personal life company is going to translate that natural language question into something a database can understand in this case a sequel query right were passing that down to third party vendor using our live connection data drill down sales engineer and then the results are pumped back into company and then company is gonna pick the best fit visualization based on the shape of the data so in this case this you know a time series question that i asked it pick the line chart a business user is able to come in here and you know just like in third party vendor able to kinda see the library of of charts that they have at their fingertips make those changes pinboard sales engineer and ill ill pause here in a sec but as they start to you know find things that are interesting maybe insightful that they wanna save for a later date they can pin this to their own live board so maybe i want to create my own im gonna say client client meeting and then right now this is going to be just you know for me from my eyes only its my own kind of safe sandbox and which i can save these insights these and but ill show in a sec how how you can share it out with others collaborate on same content but ill pause there any questions on you know the search experience the live board i started out in anything so farclient so it looks like the query up at the top is so its doing like say number of customers pinboard ends removed   removedclient so so its making that like a measure you know continuous then weekly it looks like its doing discreet versus continuous up there do you have to set that or does it just kind of understand thatsales engineer yeah ill touch on that client when we set up the worksheet so that is going to be the semantic layer that kind of underlies all this you can actually see this off to the left hand panel here this is you can think of this as kind of the the business lens into the data that im able to search against so its a great way to put guardrails around you know different metrics different measures and you can kinda define those in advance that you know how how they how they should be  how company should interpret those,0.9979,0.113,0.028,0.859
high,won,company product,sales engineer so their business user doesnt have to get you know bog down with that but thats thats definitely a great question yeah that thatclientclient that thats good sorry i was interrupting yeah might be touching on these so you can find on them if theyre going to be touched on later a couple of questions around the search,0.9468,0.256,0.058,0.686
high,won,company product,client one thing is like you clearly no like what phrases to look for right if i were brand new come to this i may not know that rightsales engineerclient is there training that we would give it to our users is there a documentation like you know it seems pretty obvious when i look at it and say a number of customers weekly easy but and users always find a way to break things right so how do we how do we navigate thatremoved   removed search types sales engineer yeah yeah theres a couple of things and its a good question client that all mentioned so the first and foremost the the search the search bar itself is going to recommend you know search terms to include so as they start typing and they say you know hey gosh i really care about what our original programming you know thats a specific value within my programming type field search types ends sales engineer i care about how thats doing and then maybe i want to compare that you know i i happen to know that we have a keyword cold versus and ill show you were a business user would see that but maybe i want to compare that with our license content right and as they type youll notice you know each key stroke company is bubbling up the most relevant suggestion and these arent just the fields that i have access to which you can see on this left hand panel these are actually the individual values right so based on the way company is connected to and comes to understand and actually build that search index for my data this is meant to make the search experience really easy for business users so they dont have to you know exactly know where theyre going they just have to you know kind of have an idea they can type it in company will hopefully the guide them to the right answer so if i asked this question this is you know lets take a look im comparing these two types of programming thats something that maybe company no just the user to select based on just kind of an inkling of what they were interested in looking at to complement you know these are specific to the data that im connected to or i i mentioned that this is a a value within the data set search types sales engineer they can complement those with what we call keywords these are meant to not require any training these are able to be leverage right out of the box like that monthly you know weekly that i used in that first search and then you know things related to time or if i have a text field contains so this has meant to be a very natural complement to what theyre already searching on within you know within their own data to kind of act as a modifier that you know helps them do some maybe more analytically complex things but abstracts that complexity with a simple to use keyword that there may be familiar with search types ends csm sure this is csmremoved   removed yeahsorry doyou have anything out therecsmsales engineercsmsales engineeri do and try we have a variety of different options that we can invoke for training whether its selfservice its instructor led its client and i are sitting down with the team both he and i have access to the who the environment so we can curate that content thats very specific to what it is youre afterclient soclient right no thats good to know go ahead myclient hello im sorry i was just sort of related controls questions so for example if im brand new and i type in number of subscribers but in the data source theyre called customers theres a way for it to make it relationcsmclientcsm yes in for client you can jump in here but thats one of my favorite things client we call them synonyms and thats a perfect example you know in the data its called one thing but in day to day business speak we call it something else and so we actually have the ability to map those day to day business terms back to what it is in the actual data set itself and this is what client is showing rightclientremoved   removedgotcha actually i was gonna ask if theres a way to set synonyms yeah clientyeahthats ityou actually call them thatcsmclientcsm yeah theyre super super powerfulclientokay because we do have that kind of issue here where one team may call it one thing for another team and maybe the nomenclature maybe a slightly different yeah okayclientclientsales engineer great and that way you know it maps to the same underlying field the same queries gonna get run no nameer if i call that number of subscribers or number of customers so thats all handled when you set up this worksheet this the semantic layer for business users you can factor in those synonym so yeah great question centralclientaccount executive sorry i just gonna say one comment of what we found is like a lot of the business teams like they they understand from a business perspective what theyre looking for they just dont know from a data perspective voice how to get it so typically as csm had mentioned the enablement is really learning how to what whats available and company how to utilize the toolremoved   removedokay perfect i industry issues account executive but once they learn that they adopt it pretty quickly because they typically have been wanting to try to get something similar to this and understand the business perspective of what this means they just didnt have the skills from a technical standpoint got it soclient and another question you might and you might be answering this later data management  functions client so its okay if you want to content so this source on the left viewer viewing behavior insurance is this something thats created within company or is that like a view in third party vendorsales engineer yeah ill definitely touch on that but it is created within company so its meant to be just kind of a lightweight semantic layer that instead of exposing an end user to maybe five or six different tables with you know from third party vendor this is the intermediary layer that makes it really easy and kind of puts it into business user friendly terms and maybe its just a subset of all of the columns from those tables so ill walkthrough exactly how we set that up and that might you know bring it all together a little more clientclientsaid it a couple of other quick ones around the search data management  functions ends clientclientyeah so what if someone wants to search something that doesnt make any sense like what are they said i want to see number of customers times total upsell count which you technically can calculate but has no value is is just a is there a way to prevent certain things from happening not that i expect people to search that is there ways to make sure because i feel like if we expose large data sets to our end users they will find a way to three data as it shouldnt be treatedremoved   removedsales engineer yeah so theres a couple couple of considered like if they actually search for a string thats not found right data drill down sales engineer company is not gonna assume or you know pick the one with the highest probability what they meant you actually have to you know specify exactly what youre looking for with something like you know if they want to look at episode number then you know company is going to try to create the kind of the best fit visualization but if it adds a search token that you know doesnt slice it a different way or is like a different level you know its its not gonna apply that to the existing visualization however if they wanted to start to create a report where maybe you do you do want to see you know hey based on show what was the episode number right underneath this that they watched within their first week company it will allow you to create that in kind of this table view where it might make more sense is if theyre actually if they have this answer and then they want to drill down to that showed level or episode level number they can kind of like i showed in the first part this drill down menu really its drill anywhere so they can drill kind have sideways based on the the data they can drill they can go down this does not have to be predefine this mirrors the attributes that you see in this left hand panel so if they want to hop to age group and then you know within this specific age group they want to hop to a you know the show name like you maybe mentioned data management  functions sales engineer and then you know within here see the episode number thats kind of like a common way that wed see a user you know leveraging that drill anywhere capability but not having to necessarily understand the exact hierarchy themselves is that already going biner yeahclient i think so its more of just the ability for people to break things which will happen with any bi tool but especially if were handling things off to end users as opposed to share rating the views they see just thinking about ways that they can incorrectly pull data out of what should be correct datasets data architecture sales engineer yeahremoved   removedclient im i feel like im taking up a lot of time with questions im just gonna float that out there for maybe you to think about okay im performing im pretty concerned about performance to live connections just knowing what happens in our current removed environment knowing how long some of our queries take to run and third party vendor knowing how much custom sequel we have to right data architecture ends client its just you know what what youre showing right now is pretty automatic just in the back of the maybe address that when we get to that part yeah and then the other thing is this is like really silly but this is this layer a little bit but is there a way to like default sort things like i noticed on the view previous to this one data drill down client yeah like this this to me is less clear then if we just sort of you know highest the lowest if something is there a way to kind of set that so that as the end user doesnt have to like look at this and try to look for whats the fifth highest they could just see clearly data drill down ends sales engineer yeah so its gonna default sort by you know the the string value so is going to be first right eight a z but a nice keyword that we see a lot of users leveraging is this top where they can just quickly grab the top seven shows right are the top five like you said and then it will sort out automatically they can also go in here and you know sort it based on the access right rightclientsales engineer and do that descending themselves csm are you familiar with the way the default sortcsm that would be the way that i would coach folks to do that as well clientsales engineerremoved   removed yeahclient okay just streamline is you could just say top  if you still want to see a lot but it would actually sorted by doing that right yeah okay search types sales engineerclientcsm android thats a great question and it goes back to the whole conversation around enablement and training the the keywords are really this part of the secret sauce right theres so many things that you can do with the keyword that doesnt require any programming whatsoever and so what we often do with folks is spend time just talking about keywords search types ends csm so lets take some business questions that you have and lets show how the keywords apply and its very interesting to me at least how quickly people adopt to those keywords and the benefit is there is no sequel coding right there is no coding period you do have the ability to write formulas but theyre not necessary,0.9998,0.162,0.017,0.821
high,won,company product,client right in their cases that make sense yeah thank you both and i had a lot of questions i appreciate your removed answering themcsm i dont know if you want to drop them in chat client i will parking lot whatever we dont get too okayclient thanksremoved   removedsales engineer yeah great so im almost finished here with this end user you know kind of of perspective of the of of company data architecture sales engineer and then ill ill maybe the more interesting part name how do we actually set all this up touch on performance the live connection with third party vendor lets say a user you know they get to a point where hey they want to start to build out a report right data architecture ends sales engineer and then you know maybe they dont quite know exactly what they want to add to the search bar they can always reference this left panel and they can say you know based on this you know if im creating a report based on these customers what was their view run time for the same you know in that first week that they signed up lets see are they lets see what close date and then maybe their status are they have they churned since that first week and you can just add those as columns within bi fledge something there i thinkwas demo managerclientlucky for you guys i have a another demo environment that i think coincides with what i was just about the show but you know any way once a once a usersales engineer signed me up always always demo magicbeauty of live with thoseyeah it should becsmsales engineerclient thousands ive done is that this is always havesales engineerremoved   removedbuilds something like a sales by store monthly right data drill down sales engineer theyve created a answer they can easily pivot to a a table view of that same answer right they can add on columns they want to see hey for those same stores you know what was the county you know the store state score so c store footage all this stuff they can add those as columns within a report they can easily download this to you know see see god forbid they need to do something in excel right this is also kind of like a a nice transparency transparency check for a lot of users to be able to go from hey i have this you know chart visualization where i see what are the stores with the highest square footage or shows with the most run time but i actually want to see the underlying values to be able to quickly toggle that that is a nice you know nice check for for a lot of users and then all the while you know company has been building the sequel to answer my question on the fly right industry issues sales engineer that query engine is writing very efficient sequel only using the tables in the data model that are needed to answer my question so a user can see that here that hey even though this was a maybe a pretty complex question maybe even the first time someones asked that question in that that exact right data management  functions sales engineer company created a a sequel query on the fly and join these tables accordingly so based on how it understands my existing data model it made these you know it was able to traverse the schemer and answer that question all without the user needing to know hey what table what fields belong to which tables data management  functions ends sales engineer or needing to write their own sequel theyre just interacting with that search bar and then this retail sales in this case this worksheet its kind of that governs layer in between the tables in the end user so if it makes sense ill pivot to how we set that up for end users unless theres any questions as i transition there company product account executiveremoved   removed i would just say do you want to show company product real quick just to at least give you an idea of theirsales engineer thats a thats a good call out account executive so company product alluded too earlier its our automated insights engine so if if a user maybe has a high level question they see something in their data but theyre theyre not quite sure what could be driving a specific change or something like that data drill down sales engineer they can you know pop in a search and then they can have company do some of that analysis for them so maybe they just wanna see you know im going to zero in on the south west here but sales jumped you know by however much this is across this period what actually drove that change you know i could drill down i could slice this by customer age group and you know store square footage you know whatever attributes i have store from square footage bucket something like that company product sales engineer but why not have company do some of that work for me company its gonna pick the columns that it thinks are most relevant based on what user search on within the data and then its gonna go out and run a change analysis algorithm here and then you know really present the results of that analysis up to me you know to to take take action on so its not meant to be a you know kind of have a replacement for any data science work or like a data haiku or something like that it is meant to augment you know kind of that casual business users analysis and then give them some some interesting in its too hopefully then take action on so within my analysis we can see this ran you know  seconds ago view what company did for me here its audit sales jumped you know  percent over that period what actually drove that change so these  stores actually made up  percent of that increase you know thats interesting i didnt know that i can save that you know in in save that for additional analysis or bring that up with my team maybe some things are more obvious right maybe its its you know its a given that these products these are are you know we just released those its its obvious that those were going to drive that change i can give it a thumbs down on and say hey this wasnt as meaningful you know show me less of that right and then maybe something thats insightful i can give it a thumbs up and its gonna show me more of that search types sales engineerremoved   removed so the next time i run company product i can you know have a more relevant answer underneath the hood this is all still live company right a search was created in the background to get to this answer but to an end user theyre able to you know quickly kind of scan through this this change analysis report and see whats whats relevant and see if they missed anything right search types ends sales engineer this is kind of a good check in kind of of you know multiplying your efforts as a as as a userclient hi is this something that is a capability that it builds over time search types client because you said it was because based on what your thought one of the the the drivers based on what people are searchingsales engineer yeah its a good question so it will you know will work day one right its not going to have as much relevant information to kind of customize the the results for but the more users leverage it the the ranking of those attributes is gonna be differentsmarter it getssales engineer the smarter it gets supposedly rightclient okaycsm yeah they call it machine learning for a reason company product clientremoved   removed rightclientclient yeah yeah its like a completely blank box theres like no way to clear it or anything like that boxcsmsales engineer yeah yeah i mean so a user has some limited ability to like tweak the parameters but as far as like yeah what what its actually running our our company product team would be who who they would who would who you would go to there was also a more in depth one where you can run a this takes a minute or two but itll look at correlations and then any outliers in your data and then you can you can tweak these parameters if if youre youre feeling adventurous but again select these for you sorry what was thatclient i said i saw the value in there yeah i was gonna ask just be when you when you hit the thumbs down does that does that only affect your experience or does that also affect other other users experience when they use company product search types sales engineer yeah its a good question so throughout the platform theres theres ai built throughout even the search experience so the fact that i as a single user search for cholesterol reduce or right that is something that company is going to more heavily wait based on my individual preferences right but it will bubble those up across the team and kind of have a a lower waiting i believe the waiting is like you know  percent of what you search on you know it is going to be kind of relevant to you the other suggestions that you get are relevant to you and your personal search history search types ends sales engineer and then maybe like  percent is going to be the team as a whole crowd sourced so the same kind of have a slice would go for company product so based on all the recommendations it gets across the team its gonna more heavily wait the ones that you personally gave it versus you know just one person on the team kind of ofremoved   removedyou know dragging it down for everyone and thats something to be admin can also control as far as resetting that or disabling gotchaclientsales engineer great no awesome questions i think right now it makes sense to kinda show hey how do we get to it and experience like this data architecture sales engineer you know how do we make it so easy for end users we you know have just a few minutes left here i want to quickly show our connection with third party vendor and then what i was searching and how we build that semantic layer so the first step is going to be actually creating a connection with you know the cloud data warehouse and with a live connection as i think was it client client alluded too you know thats something other tools do absolutely right we have a purpose built connector for third party vendor and we are not moving any data within company so once i and put my credentials i would be able to see all the tables within that specific connection the company its given me in this case you know i dont have any filter to retail sales data architecture ends sales engineer let me take that off but company is going to start to you know serve as a pointer to those tables so that in a data curator data expert can start to kind of polish those up and create that search experience for users so the first step you see these tables right data management  functions sales engineer some of them are related somewhere not company is going to understand if i have any joins or primary foreign key relationships set in third party vendor it would just inherit those so in this case these tables are related in third party vendor company would be able to leverage that single source of truth right so you dont have to recreate that on your own if that was not defined in third party vendor you could add that yourself and then from there you know if i want to actually search on those underlying tables i can absolutely do that however you know most business users theyre not gonna want to search you know what is or is this one this fact retail sales apparel table rightremoved   removed data management  functions ends sales engineer giving them this with you know kind of these key fields and more cryptic you know this probably isnt as bad as what maybe you guys have seen some of the column names that are pretty ambiguous i want to actually make this you know more polished experience for them and not have to worry about the underlying tables data management  functions sales engineer what i can do then is create a worksheet based on those tables so in this case you know im gonna create one im gonna just use one thats already been created for me that retail sales that we searched after our after we transition so this is youll notice this is still built on that same data model that third party vendor headset but you know this is a few more tables but this this worksheet is going to serve as kind of a subset of all those different fields so from this damn customer table you can see i only blocked maybe four of the  fields here right i only i only needed to grab three from the fact table right because all my dimensions were were from those corresponding tables and then if i needed to create any business logic say like a custom formula that wasnt in third party vendor i can do that within company and that would be executed at run time based on those inputs so any questions there on i guess what the worksheet actually entails or you know setting that up the the joins yesclientsales engineerclient you have cases where you would join the same two tables in different ways to get different answers for example our content met a data at client removed you would join on a different id if its a series versus if its a movie how does how would that spot handle multiple joins so the exact same tablessales engineer yeah absolutely thats something we ive seen done before especially if you have maybe multiple date fields like with the merchandising or supply chain use case they have they have like an order date a ship date and then a delivery date all in the fact table they want to then join those to the the date dimension table you can do that within company you know editing a join and then adding a new oneremoved   removedcsm okay and and try and that brings up a good question and back to what your your earlier question was around how do we prevent the end user for breaking things yeah data management  functions ends namecsm thats always a goal right the idea within company is and weve seen it multiple ways we we provide the worksheet or the the you know the layer the business layer as specific as we can in many cases right so for brand new users our suggestion would be theyll give them access to the entire the entirety of third party vendor you know what is their business question that theyre trying to resolve  percent of the time and then model to that and as other folks become you know more power users are more familiar then you can start looking at adding in different types of our different content different tables different joined strategies like you mentioned so we just find throwing the whole soup at at folks can be challenging sosales engineer right and i think your earlier question again yeah showing consistent metrics you know for all users thats something that you know ideally you would set in third party vendor like you have a gross profit column in third party vendor right that everyone can use and thats the single source of the truth no nameer what tool youre using if that was not the case you know you can define that within company and then all the company users you know can follow can use that same gross profit and hopefully its calculated the same way and in a third party vendor or removed as wellclient yeah we we have a lot of like we get blocked sometimes when we want it if we were to want to create custom sequel by like engineering teams at times just for being able to create views so we do have a lot of custom sequel like well have im going to make a separate like we have like  line case statements that used for different fields they get to the values we need to we can just create that logic the exact same way you show the gross profit here yeah so thats justsales engineerclientremoved   removed no work or measuresales engineer okay correct yeah so if thats something like yeah like age group is kind of this be yep exactly yeahclientsales engineer right something like that when that gets run you know in a as a search company is going to create that sequel that you know follows exactly what you described there for you so youd have to just define it as a formula and all end users can can get that didnt getclient and hes considering these formulas or just sequel right yeahsales engineer thats whats being run as far as creating them like actually typing them within the ui this is not sequel this is kind of like theres like excel formulas you know so you wrap a song around you know the fields that you want and then we have kind of a whole host of either aggregate kind of like the level of detail functions in third party vendor or you know if you need to do some other logicokay coolgotcha okayclient taxes company not third party vendorrightcorrect correctclientsales engineerclientclientremoved   removedcsmand we covered a lot of these kinds of things in in training as

would be through that but i think were going to be good to record i think i think the scripts and get enough shape im just trying to open it now on my phone and just one correct  small talk  project systems engineermarketing  often his edits sweet yeah i think its good enough to record lets see once he gets on if everything looks like its gonna go whats happening youre way man hows everything becky account executive  busy man busy busy im located in city city so its its constantly madness im finishing out the year crazy how about you hows why right now project systems engineermarketing  id like to say not crazy but yeah its its crazy account executive  yeahproject systems engineermarketing  week has been like nice my my wife the coffee farm she works for they put up an ad on i think they send out an email and put up an ad on instagram and got like  and something orders so they have to december i think  second is the last day that they can ship coffee to get it to japan before the years out shes so shes been at work all week which means the kids have been a daycare and preschool all week so its been nice account executive  some some alone time project systems engineermarketing  yeah yeah i can actually like sit here and work without anyone yelling theyre throwing food account executive  hello hi is man thats awesome thats crazy i mean one instagram ad these days blows everything project systems engineermarketing  did she told me when they their email i think they send it out to like i wanna say said like four  or  customers like people that had been there and sign up for their email and they got like  something orders out  pricing  project systems engineermarketing  remember how many bags that was but like over  percent order rate on that and then they put it on instagram and i think she said they sold like  bucks worth of coffee yeah account executive  it just oregon like the organic being said that theyre selling or like true  small talk  project systems engineermarketing  its its the beans are great i mean she brought it back home for us its just after harvest season now account executive  so theres a lot of the customers arent in japan or thats where the beach wow coolproject systems engineermarketing  yeah yeah she works on the farm or they actually grown but its a japanese couple of that runs it and so all the if youve been to hawaii when theyre normally here ill do that theres times that ive driven through town back pre covid where i was like am i the only white guy here right now account executive  yeah project systems engineermarketing  japanese tourists come here and they all go to that farm and especially the older ones have money to burn so when they cant come in they order the coffee account executive  yeah nice man thats awesome thats so cool i guess it makes sense its you know i wanna say relatively close to japan but closer than city project systems engineermarketing  yeah yeah its from what ive read i cant remember who did this study i think it was some government office they said the most spend just whatever you would call it the most profitable tours and the us was the japanese in hawaii  small talk ends  account executive  well as project systems engineermarketing  far as the amount of money that theyll spend on a day by day basis account executive  love that love to hear that yeah you taking some time off during the holiday at all or week or the following week i think a lot of people client  are taken off next project systems engineermarketing  week so i will hopefully be slow and then the week after i think wanna take that shut down well see how about youaccount executive  yeah im gonna try im gonna try to i know i have calls up until christmas see but mainly internal but yeah im gonna definitely try not hopefully a couple of days i think is all i need is i can really get but yeah yeah  small talk  project systems engineermarketing  if theres money on the table its kinda hard to take time off account executive  i know i should i should let me ping client here he did accept so project systems engineermarketing  yeah account executive  really coming up that back to backs project systems engineermarketing  hows city right now man is it back to normal holiday spectacular account executive  yeah its its nuts its easier than ever a lot of tourists come in to see the tree i mean christmas in city is awesome the last thing but yeah its its back to normal id say it was it was it goes down for i have pictures when i lived here when it was full blown kovid the streets nothing whats cool now is there was never outdoor seating but now there was because of covid and they kept at all project systems engineermarketing  yeah account executive  less cars on the road means less honking but more outdoor reservations which is like really sweet in city project systems engineermarketing  niceaccount executive  yeah  hey guys sorry about that client  small talk ends  account executive  thanks for joining me i appreciate it i know back to back client  yeah you bet account executive  hopefully squeeze some lunch in here awesome project systems engineermarketing ill let you ill let you take control here but i think we all we need to do is first off is it okay if we record the session totally up to you if if if we cant client  thats account executive  okay but yeah i think we just project systems engineermarketing you open up your cluster get a couple of examples and then well well get the video created for you guys project systems engineermarketing  yeah client i went through and not outdated the script on my side that sorry i just got a chance to do it so i didnt send it over your way but updated it and my my little third party vendor doc that im maintaining and so ive got that open on my phone so if you wanna if you want to open this your company instance we can just jump into it and either walkthrough it make sure everything looks good and or just go through it live and assume its all gonna look good and reported,0.9997,0.215,0.029,0.755
low,lost,small talk,client  yeah you you tell me what what you need me to do here project systems engineermarketing  me fair enough can take it to so i can get a copy as well lets go ahead and if you dont mind open then company i think we should be goodclient  yeah im on the pin board now do you want me to start with like a blank  pinboard ends  project systems engineermarketing  sorry im seeing on my friend double screens i see some chat client  okay client  there you go project systems engineermarketing  perfect do you mind if i take control i dont know if your company let me do that through zoom or not client  you can give it a shot project systems engineermarketing  okay so im gonna try and do a training room of the project systems engineermarketing  zoom and remove some of the bremoveder stuff see if i can  pinboard  project systems engineermarketing  perfect okay yeah let me try had some of these zoom and news and then this go to and this is looking good did you have any preference client one of the things that i like to do on the pin board is to use explore on one of the visuals and then maybe do a filter or something like that and then also to present one of them and share that drill down do you have a preference on any of these client  does it matter if were just trying to think what would be easiest wont be the easiest one would probably be the product one im guessing the one you were actually just on pinboard ends  project systems engineermarketing  okay yeah let me go to that quick man just trying to get this live on the fly and see how it goes project systems engineermarketing  filtered so this quarter maybe client  the the data is only through september project systems engineermarketing  okay maybe ill try the one next to that then client  all of the data is through september though so its just this quarters a bad filter is project systems engineermarketing  okay what about these options client  now it might be easier i dont know if we just want to type it in oops sorry somebody whos calling me on my thing  data drill down  project systems engineermarketing  what if we do a replace maybe see what options are exempt once a year with quarter view client  the quarter is probably not like an interesting one project systems engineermarketing  yeahclient  i dont know if or do you want to like stick with like the suggestions or or if we type something in eventually does that just become a suggestion if you type it enough times  data drill down ends  project systems engineermarketing  definitely i could type it in enough times should client  so like as a filter for instance you could put like if you typed in a cct lets see if we get yeah that account type group to even actually no sorry i dont do a contract to there should be like an account discount indicated the first one project systems engineermarketing  cool client  and you can just say equals y pops up project systems engineermarketing  why client  yeah lets see what that does client  yeah so this is like all of our business that has an project systems engineermarketing  okay okay lets try that again and see if it shows up now project systems engineermarketing  right project systems engineermarketing  what is the ph d by the wayclient  its homeowners okay its a horrible name but thats somebody  years ago made that project systems engineermarketing  yeah its the funnel data yes like product homeowners something client  yes project systems engineermarketing  okay its not giving us that project systems engineermarketing  hey this makes sense client  yeah i mean the adds not bad like for instance like the account type group too thats thats an okay one project systems engineermarketing  i think client  its not going to visualize it though because its im trying to think if you if you go back for a second to get out of this thing client  well what if you just do the basic one nicole down by month the second one i wonder if theres better options now the pre post doesnt really mean project systems engineermarketing  yeah probably i was gonna make tables that client  im im in my maybe not try like the account type group to now i wonder if it just makes because theres only three values wonderful make three lines yeah okayproject systems engineermarketing  yeah  something like that client project systems engineermarketing  cool ill get back to that that was under ad right client  yeah project systems engineermarketing  yep  small talk  client  throw myself im doing this survey project systems engineermarketing  okay cool thanks client  thats the last thing we need person message to project systems engineermarketing  you should see some of them that i get anytime i have to share my entire screen i always tell everyone sorry about my friends client  in where client  yeah project systems engineermarketing  especially now our our local brewery started doing a draft of the week yeah client project systems engineermarketing  so now thats probably what  percent of my text messages and client  yeah account executive  hey project systems engineermarketing hawaii so client  jeez you know i was liking you it for us now account executive  much regularly someones project systems engineermarketing  gotta do it account executive  logan breweries its its a little different coming from a line up there yeah shes coasters client  well you know project systems engineermarketing if you need me to make a trip out and doing this in person account executive  itd probably project systems engineermarketing  be easier client  yeah i thinkproject systems engineermarketing  so other than the  hour name but client  you know what a sacrifice project systems engineermarketing  my gosh we just had a a systems engineermarketing off site in city but we were flying back from we went to my brothers in missouri for thanksgiving and our lay over was an outlay and we booked that before we can books before the systems engineermarketing offsite got announced and so and now law i switched over to that took a rental car down to city and my wife flew back with the kids tool here  small talk ends  project systems engineermarketing  and my gosh i dont know when were going to flag and after that it sounded like it was not not like its like no its fine until we got to la and then she said they are ones

low,lost,next steps,client  yes project systems engineermarketing  yeah so they got a they got here hour and a half earlier hour hour and a half whatever and then there was the southwest so theres of course a plane at the gate and then they said on the runway waiting for that they said itll be  minutes and then  minutes and they said it will be another  minutes and then after that they said theres a problem at the gate so well see one,0.6048,0.093,0.033,0.874

low,lost,demo,client  yeah because std doesnt show up in future it doesnt like i dont know what happened to like the indexing or something but it doesnt work like that so i have to add it as a filter like you see where like term effective date is like down there project systems engineer yeah client  i had to add it as a as a filter up here project systems engineer i explained that to me im not sure that ive done it this way before client  yeah so the screen looks a little me yeah so if you go over here project systems engineer okay client  and then you find product sticking in this filter  data drill down  project systems engineer okay client  and then once youre in here you can say hey std client jody done okay project systems engineerclient  and then when you have the byproduct project systems engineer i need to do by product first or just clicked on products to get it to show client  just click on you dont have to do the byproduct  data drill down ends  project systems engineer yeah client  well i lied you do need to do it by product because youre going to need to have two lines so that you can throw him on here if you dont do the byproduct you dont get this project systems engineer my goodness okay client  yeah its a little convoluted it should work like this where you just kinda type it in like this but for some reason i dont know on the back end project systems engineer yeah i might might file that is a bug if you dont mind because i think it has words like that in the past client  yeah he definitely should i know client this has come up and prior conversations with blake or or somebody i think theyre gonna look into it with nick but,0.9541,0.129,0.079,0.792
low,lost,demo,account executive  okay yeah yes right theres a ticket thats gone that im seeing the chat all morning so theyre on it project systems engineer yeah cool account executive  okay awesome project systems engineer alright let me start this over then and then client if i start to fumble around i might need you to client  yep you project systems engineer got me back to the promised land here  wrapup ends  client  second sir so i always found my typing gets  times worse when somebody is watching me project systems engineer yeah project systems engineer sometimes folks will say you want me to just record this myself and and say and just trust me its going to be a pain in the butt once you start recording yourself its so do i i had by product and the search now right  data drill down  client  right so what we did is is this your only right so get rid of the versus last year and then by product client client  yeah answer and then click on the bi h hell be on the left the data source and then you see the product there when you hover over it theyll be a little filter icon click that and then pick a steph a d  data drill down ends  project systems engineer theres a couple of others right vhs see and maybe one more client  just a phd just to to okay and then hit done and then hit the magnifying glass and then hit the gear down below settings and driving product up into this license color project systems engineer okay ill let it a lot of this out so it doesnt look so clunky this by the time you have other users on here it should work like normal alright cool and then we compared the std august and september client  yep project systems engineer and then did you just go with the the ones that suggested or do you have anything you wanted to add or remove client  for instance you can take out like your month right because project systems engineer yeah its already what were looking at client  yeah so you could run it with something like this the one that pop like the mary driver account is in this list thats important yeah cool project systems engineerclient  so so then do you want to go to the company feature project systems engineer yeah im just trying to move one of my zoom things out of the way client  gotcha project systems engineer screenshot for client  you can project systems engineer just more interesting insights client  lovely project systems engineer thats yeah no were looking for client  can you go to the one that i did before same thing okay i dont know why it would be different now but client  its a little misleading because even though it says like january to january if you had any of these things youll see the august and september are packed i think its because i did this year and so it does that term effective date filter on the the visualization itselfproject systems engineer should we could go in here that youre on chrome right client  yeah do project systems engineer you want me to go ahead and change these so that it makes more sense client  fine by me project systems engineer yeah well figure out what this bug is but at least for seo purposes we can make it not confusing  data drill down  project systems engineer and then when you called out is this top one right yes okay cool and then i was thinking i always like to show drill down because thats a powerful and since weve been following the same flow most of this i was thinking you just drop a drill down right here  data drill down ends  client  sure project systems engineer so lets see anything you think would be interesting here client  doesnt matter how many values come back  versus too project systems engineer no i think for the purposes of showing that you can get granular its fine client  gateway partner name then would be a good one  okay what is that project systems engineerproject systems engineerclient  its one of like the the the aggregators that we do business through project systems engineer okay cool yeah i think that makes sense let me see if theres anything else we need to grab that i think were probably good to go now exploring the percent see data will make a fake connection here real quick project systems engineer connection and you guys are on its too project systems engineer okay project systems engineer i think thats it is there anything else that that you would want to show on here client or you feel like weve got got a pretty much cover client  yeah i think were were pretty much covered did you did you need like a pin board project systems engineer i think we got that at the beginning right client  okay you got it okay i just wanna make sure you got it project systems engineer yeah i had my campaigns up and running already something doesnt show up but i think were all good there the only other thing that i had is if youre if youre using mobile or if you wanna use were not  okay  theres no immediate planted client project systems engineerclient project systems engineer yeah sometimes when we have like sales folks out in the field or whatever client  they project systems engineer want to use it but i assume most of your folks are behind the desk when theyre signing policies client  yeah generally yeah project systems engineer okay cool then i think were good,0.9992,0.182,0.026,0.792

low,lost,company product,account executive  okay so look at you know a few of the things that you know the back and i had discussed and this is also encompasses what weve been working on with the client team is right like client third party vendor you have a ton of data youve created collecting data right youve got data on who customers are what they by demographic information financial information all of this data same challenge on the client side that that feedback and i discussed is like all that data is really spread out all over the place making that do use for getting you know access to that data in that analysts in analytics on top of that data is really the kind of the challenging part in it kinda comes down to really five five main things that we see across the board  data architecture  account executive  and this isnt just a client third party vendor thing this is like everybody that we work with right one is that you have multiple data environments right i think we talked about you know data bricks third party vendor third party vendor big query the back i think we talked about third party vendor  w as well  data management  functions  account executive  yeah yeah thats right a lot of data in a lot of different places which makes it really hard when youre trying to do like this all encompassing analysis the second pieces traditional bi tools require a ton of work right whether thats etl in out of the data warehouse or whether thats modeling changing the data building reports etcetera the third one is that a lot of bi can break when you put a ton of data inside of it right so you have go through you know scrubbing that data you have to go through like removing some of that really granular data that oftentimes is like the most valuable stuff  industry issues  account executive  next one is like dashboards arent really answering every single question right just because you have a dashboard a lot of times we see customers asking for hey give me a data export right i want to see it in a different way i want to really fine grained details around hey one of our customers by right  search types  account executive  a lot of that is really hard to do traditional bi tools so today were going to kind of walkthrough how company helps with with with all thoseaccount executive  okay so just kinda foundationally here right company analytics platform is really based on the concept of search right thats really thats really the primary interface in in the idea behind this is that its usable  industry issues  account executive  its familiar to that is analyst but even like non technical people or or customers right and it does two things one it gives your analyst teams the ability to job significantly faster right taking you know a massive backlog of requests for dashboards or reports internally that down or a lot of folks say it takes us you know two weeks to go create a new dashboard just due to that backlog  search types  account executive  so the ability to give those teams the ability to turn that down to literally minutes and then secondly again to get your your non technical users or your customers the ability to slice data on their own without being a bi expert the second piece of this is all around company ai driven insights right  company feature  account executive  how do we surface trends anomalies things that are interesting bubble that up put it right in front of your face because you might not be looking for it but its an idea of where you can go in and take immediate action we we talked a lot about like the the client  initiative which is actually we we do a lot of that right  use cases  account executive  a couple of we call like customer  or like a subscriber  right so i put a couple of examples of those right like who lou leveraging company and this is all around their content systems engineermarketing and strategy teams right  use cases ends  account executive  understand who what when around what people are watching right and theyre doing this across  removed of data so theres two things that come come from company on that is one usability were talking about a systems engineermarketing team the second one is scale of data right,0.9951,0.1,0.004,0.897
low,lost,about company,account executive  same thing out at name right giving their category managers the ability to see you in shelf level data run whos buying what when where and why and of course if they have a ton of data as well the last one here that ill touch on is is master card right  use cases ends  account executive  name actually embed company into the b to b payment portal so they had a low analytical adoption right the the growth or adoption  percent by providing a more usable layer for their analytics customers account executive  the next piece here is looking at everyone that were talking to is in one of three bucks like theyre talking about moving to a modern unified cloud data warehouse  data architecture  account executive  theyre in process of doing that or theyre already there the real challenge that company solves is is one of two right is first accessing that data is is difficult right the same reason that youre not going to give a salesperson you know a data bricks license or a third party vendor license theyre not gonna know what to do with it right they just care about finding answers within their data the second challenge that i hit on earlier was you if youre all this work to to get data in a great place and then you have to move it out of your cloud data warehouse  industry issues  account executive  and then you have to build your dashboards and reports for each yelling in in into your bi solution to second challenges company connect directly to your data right and we go beyond the dashboard right you the dashboard somebody wants to export somebody wants to see in a predefine a different way they want a bar chart instead of a a pie chart right and all that stuff goes into this never ending cycle of you know building and replacing and modify your existing dashboards and reports so with company we we change that right we connect directly to your data where its at provide a usable layer on top of that data for all of your analysts and and users in in in customers industry issues ends  account executive  digitally as i as i touched on theres kind of two ways to consume company the first would be you know what you see on the left which we call company enterprise this is just kind of like internal use cases the way a lot of customers are leveraging company but also the ability to embed so i talked about the master card story there as well i know that weve talked about tm one this would be the idea right is when you have all of your data connect company to that but the branding of company would actually be third party vendor branding so your customers wouldnt know its company they just think hey third party vendor created this great portal where i can log in and access all my customer data slice and dice it and get all the information that i need out of it via a third party vendor tm one portal  search types  account executive  so last kind of thing yours is you know what really makes company different you see some bi tools are starting to come out with hey we have this search feature to to look at our data the idea here is that not all searches created equal right what what really makes company different is first pieces like its its kind of like an third party vendor or third party vendor search right and the way that you interact with it its familiar and youll youll see that in false demo but how that actually works is really from our our indexing and ranking of your data right  data architecture  account executive  as soon as we would establish connection to something like data bricks we come to understand that in a way that makes it searchable right thats really like you know from our query engine in the example is youll type in a search right like hey show me t mobile systems engineermarketing events this month or you know last month or or or whatever right it takes the english language search turns it into sequel sends it to the data warehouse and provides a response back with very fast performance like sub two second performance right and we do that at scale largely because of how were architected right were leveraging the data warehouse is both the data repository as well as the data engine right all of those are you know the data breaks the third party vendors whatever of the world have been architected to be extremely performance and we leverage that kind of power company so any questions on this before we handed over to systems engineer client  is is systems engineer gonna cover just the kind of the end user experience or are we going to touch upon i know we only have you know  minutes left or so but how are we going to touch upon like what does it take to set up a data source or like a third party vendor for example in terms of you know initially getting it getting the indexescreated and ranking and all the whatever met a data needs to get set up to connect to it to ask the questions,0.9977,0.104,0.006,0.891

low,lost,demo, data architecture  account executive  on monday we establish the connection to the both the data birth environment and the third party vendor environment tomorrow were actually going to be kicking off like extra tuning and count against that criteria but the idea here is that like on monday we connected yesterday systems engineer was able to go in and build out kind of a mock dashboard that they had already created so again the idea here is that the data doesnt need to necessarily be perfect right and the and how quickly we can connect and start searching and start building is like again we can we can do this and like an so it moves really really quickly client  got it cool agenda  account executive  okay systems engineer over to you systems engineer  can you do hey guys nice to meet all of you let me just share my screen systems engineer  okay so yeah i will cover the the part about im connecting and how you set things up the met a data but what i want to cover off first is kind of the user experience  data architecture  systems engineer  but but before i get into that i will spend a minute here talking about the data that will be looking at in the the demo environment so its a retail data set its just a demo data set but it has to do with the grocery store chain and what we do it is we weve connected to a third party vendor instance in this case and this is the schemer  data management  functions  systems engineer  so this is this is company that im in right now theres more than administrative view when you connect you can see the the different tables like terribly complex schemer but theres two fact tables and several dimension taking off of it and you can see that theres mostly inner joins as a couple of outer join setup between some of the tables  data management  functions ends  systems engineer  so what we do is we put a semantic layer on top of this the the users will interact with its something that we call a worksheet and what a worksheet is is just think of it as a curated subject area that allows your users to interact with the various fields that are in each one of these tables and and it works for you dont have to include all of the fields so it could be a subset of the different columns from each of these tables and then we also enrich it with formulas we change some of the names to make it more user friendly we put it in some some complex formulas,0.9922,0.117,0.019,0.864
low,lost,company product,systems engineer  we geo and code some of the data things like that and then we share it with the users and thats what they interact with to you search and then also to build the the dashboards and the pin board by boards we column which are dashboards and that they interact with  data architecture  systems engineer  so i just wanted to give you that and ill show you after we get through the ui portion how we set this up and well do it really fast though because we do have a lot to cover in client  i have a quick question does this support like federated queries where youll build the met a data model across different sources and and then well let you know create separate queries and pull them back together again systems engineer  it it supports a federated model with our partnership with a solution called star burst and were also going to be connecting to other federation technologies like danielle and to know though in the future but right now we have a connector to star burst and start verse would be used as the federation engine natively we connect to a source at a time and you can connect to many different sources right in in this demo instance ive got connections to data bricks third party vendor third party vendor yeah all all the different cloud data where client  sure but a worksheet natively can only connect the one connection or systems engineer  correct client  everyone systems engineer  that is correct yeah account executive  yeah and like the other ideas also like if you have a connection to third party vendor and data bricks and third party vendor  w you can build a but a dashboard that encompasses all of those but as youll see like you know searching from a data bricks query then toan third party vendor query wouldnt happen but you could still have those on the same pin board that would still show up  pinboard  systems engineer  yeah thats a good point right so so while we and and youll see what we mean by a pin board live barber column yeah the account executive point you can connect to many different sources in a white board so let me jump back over here and as i said well well get to the how you set this up but this is when a user logs in this is just a landing page or homepage thats meant to kind of be a launching point for users within company and its showing you high level kpis up at the top that i can customize and put it in there based on what i want to see on a daily basis when i come in but it also shows you a list of all of the different content thats already been created either by myself or by others and shared with me and you know we we make heavy have kind have more social media type constructs when were looking at things that have been trending both from a live board perspective and an answer and the answer is just the single search where a live board is a collection of searches and you can see the different views so you can find out whos interested in white and i can click on any of these as an example if i click on this store performance itll open up one of these dashboards which may look familiar to other technology that you might be using,0.9971,0.136,0.003,0.861

low,lost,company product,systems engineer  i can click on the little pin there and ill create a new pin board called systems engineer added to it and then when i close this itll just go back to its normal south knowing that i only have read access to this without except for the explorer capabilities and the fact that i can save it or i could just save any of these to my own personal pin board as well  industry issues  systems engineer  you know i can say no yeah i like this chart here i want to say that desystems engineer as well but the real power of of company is what we we like to say is that where the dashboard and starts by begins because not all dashboards answer every question i might have  data drill down  systems engineer  as an example i may want to look at a trend of sales over time by my store regions but i dont have that on this dashboard and i dont know where it exists account executive  you just click systems engineer sorry real quick so like back when we were talking about earlier is like the sales by store region in the top left like that could come from called data bricks and then that sales by state could come from something like third party vendor right so different environments but still on the same day client  but if i change the filters at the top both would change at the same time so if isystems engineer  yes yes yes so you can theres a configuration option on the dashboard itself where you can configure the filters to match up so obviously region would be different column in third party vendor then it would be in you know in third party vendor or third party vendor you would just have to accommodate for those you know kind of mapping out company employee  okay and are the components onsite interactive like meaning if you click on california your top  stores account executive to just california state systems engineer  right now we do that via the filters where if i if i selected a particular filter if i select the california from a filter would obviously change all of them from a clicking perspective thats on our road map scheduled for later this year company employee  thank you systems engineer  so the the the point is that you know wow a dashboard is good and it provides a lot of information i always may have another question so i can just click up here and search data you can see im looking at these retail sales a worksheet that i showed you earlier and i can just start typing i can see you know what i want to look at my sales i want to look at it by store region i want to look at that quarterly and i wanna look at it for the last three years lets say and as i type itll quickly generate the the sequel based on the tokens that i put in there send it out to the underlying database and then return the results in a best fit representation and you can see that and ill ill redo that as soon as i come into the search bar ill be prompted with certain suggestions  search types  systems engineer  and again weve got a machine learning algorithm under the covers your usage based ranking algorithm that will suggest things and then as i type you can see that itll make other suggestions and refine and based on what im typing in there and its not just making recommendations for the columns that i might be looking for but actual values as well search types ends  systems engineer  so as i type essay it can be you know sales or it can be a customer name it could be a product name etcetera and as i continue to type theyll be refine so what we do is we token eyes all of the distinct values in the data  data drill down  systems engineer  so its easy for a user to to to find what theyre looking for earlier today i was in the the plc environment for client and i was looking for i was doing my own little searches for minnesota vikings as soon as i started typing minnesota vikings came up i was looking for you know my zip code as soon as i start typing that came up so it makes it very easy to find things as an example if i want to know the sales for a particular person you know salary heres all the listings of sally ill pick the person that i want so you know allows you to quickly ask the questions and get answers in a in a very easy manner that really anyone can use,0.9983,0.143,0.023,0.834

low,lost,pricing,systems engineer  let me pause there any any questions on on that on the search company employee  yes whats the volume off the effective like how many number of removed systems engineer  and this one i think that its not many theyre just like a  removed i think its not very big the one i was using on the underlying nationwide today i think it had about  removed and it was coming back that in two seconds late this but it was coming back in about you know four seconds five seconds yeah,0.81,0.122,0.0,0.878
low,lost,company product,systems engineer  and thats the point you know we dont have to bring in any data we dont have to pre aggregate to build cubes we dont have to harmonize the data and get it to a certain size so it fits within the dashboard were just hitting the data live and then once i yeah  data architecture  client  sorry systems engineer if if something is slow running the solution for performance you know alleviating performance issues is optimizing the the data model on thedatabase side right on the data will have so theres nothing that you guys do and your engine that would improve performance i suspect right  data architecture ends  client  is that fair to say rather weve always done all the heavy lifting is done on the end the data where else systems engineer  thats a fair statement the the the heavy lifting that we do is from the eliminating some of the back and forth that you would find in an interactive environment from a filter perspective by token eyes in the values  data drill down  systems engineer  so if i start typing you know im on look for the south west i dont have to go back to the database to get these suggestions these have all been token eyes with an company so that helps with performance right there you know without having to make a database here to get these values so  data management  functions  client  and do most example typically go to like a star schemer data model dimensional data model to support this type of stuff or you know the systems engineer  that really really depends i i find that a lot of people have d normalized structures because theyre used to a dashboard environment where theyre constantly moving data around but star scheme as work great for us we we are schemer agnostic where we can work with the d normalized or third party vendor or star schemer i wouldnt recommend a third normal form schemer that that will not perform well its something a schemer that should be optimized specifically for analytics and reporting purpose  data architecture  company employee  okay can company host data like if if we get like right now its a live connection to the database but can we connect to an extractsystems engineer  no we we used we used to have that model and we found that most companies and we we support isnt very large models we had an in memory database we still have it that that we created because were a  year old company at the time when were designing company they were really werent any commercially available databases that had the the performance that we required to give you the interaction that youre seeing here so we built our own in memory database but over time as as third party vendor and third party vendor and other technologies data bricks became more commercially available with outstanding performance we found that customers didnt want to move data into our proprietary engine or are extracts and it was a very good engine  data transfer  systems engineer  and then we had companies that were running  terabyte within company engine but then you had to procure the hardware yeah do all the etl so we moved away from there to just a database model client  what about blending with on desktop data right thats the kind of the newest thing a lot of people are doing is upload your spreadsheet that you got and merge it with data and the data where else does it support that  data architecture  systems engineer  yeah well were working on a a capability that will allow users to do that right now the data does have to be in in the underlying data warehouse but were working on a feature that will allow you to upload to the data warehouse automatically so it will you know be a wizard based upload the data bring it into the data warehouse work create the the the connection and the the table structure and then load the data  data transfer  systems engineer  again thats something thats on the road map for this year systems engineer  yeah are there other questions okay so so once we once we get what were looking for from a search perspective i you know i may cause me to have other questions of the data data drill down  systems engineer  so what i wanna do is i want to save this off i can put it on that that live board that i created earlier and now theyre not knowing that its safe that allows me to start navigating around so perhaps i want to drill down here again one of the other advantages of company is that we dont have to predefine any drill paths or any hierarchies whatever is defined in the worksheet we can drill too so as an example if i want to drill to store name i can drill down you can see when i drill down and updated my search bar automatically for me kept me in context shows where i drill down in terms of the fact that i drilled on this particular quarter for this particular line which is south west line i can continue to pin my results as i as i move along here so again im creating a dashboard on the fly i can interact with the with the search bar and i can see you know what i only want to look at my top  stores as an example and itll filter those out i can change the the view if i want to look at it i dont know in a in a pie chart it might be a little bit too busy for a pie chart that i can continue to go back and forth you know maybe now i only show me the top  instead and then i can pin these results so very quickly here im kind of having a conversation with the data as i move along i can say lets look at the mosquitoes store here drill down theyre looking to buy for product name again its keeping everything in sync its adding most filters here so i can continue to interact in in manner you know again ill say maybe lets look at our top  again and then finally him at the lowest green of detail maybe i wanna see i dont know whos buying the mothers choice wheelchair here i can say you know what show me the underlying data and it will go and itll show you the exact records that what makes up that  removed  data management  functions  systems engineer  its these two transactions here and i can say i want to add in additional context and then that will add in all of the details so now were at the lowest screen of data thats available in the in this particular worksheet right so now i have all the details i can download this information and carried forward so just a real quick scenario how somebody could very quickly interact with the data any any questions on that systems engineer  okay and you know its some of these i can always look at the query thats being generated as well so if i click this query visualize it here you can see this is how its traversing through those tables or that schemer that i showed you earlier and i can always go in and get the the actual sequel as while its being generated data management  functions ends  systems engineer  so we have a very powerful query engine that will optimize the sequel for the underlying database one of the things if i add in one more metric here lets say i wanna look at client  the do you have the option to hide those options from certain users systems engineer  yes so anything that that we do you can customize this entire interface from company everywhere which is our embedded solution that allows you to to to put the content in your own portals or or applications that you create and if we have time ill show you a little bit about how we do that you can customize that thing complete interface  use cases  account executive  yeah company employee the the whole idea here is like only like for example like the sales team like shouldnt be seeing like maybe like systems engineermarketing data or maybe like the sales team and the west shouldnt see data for the sales team and the east or you know if you have this for a client say anheuser busch can only see relevant data to analyzer bush right so can absolutely lock this down for data governance security  use cases ends  client  hello i was the level i was thinking a little bit more technical than that like not showing the sequel thats running to certain users who maybe dont account executive  yeah systems engineer  yeah youre youre talking more locking down the user interface yep client  yeah lucky now that so that people cant see what the query actually is so that they cant you know hold on and it will copy and paste this into some other thinking or whatever and do all sorts of weird things right but mostly for non technical users so that they dont data management  functions  account executive  yeah totally yeah and systems engineer sounds like we can do that systems engineer  yeah through through company everywhere so yeah company employee  before you move forward the query thats generated only users the tables that have columns in this liquidity like he doesnt do join on all the tables that are in a star schemer but only to select the columns systems engineer  yeah yeah itll do it progressive joined based on what you to the query so as an example of that i just added this extra metric here average basket size which happens to be a computer field that we built in the worksheet that is the computation between multiple fact tables if i look at the query visualize or now you can see that its much more complex than it was in fact in with the fact that were generating multiple queries you know sub selects in the in the query that were sending to the database and company employee  what that will look formats are along like excel and  pinboard  systems engineer  so so yeah by the way i can change any of these to a tabular view as well and i have the ability to download to csv pdf for excel thank company employee  you systems engineer  yeah so you know i showed you a quick scenario there of how i drill down just hit my back  company feature  systems engineer  but year one of the other things that you can use company for us to identify things that maybe you dont really know where to start so as an example here i cansee in the southwest were trending up but here i can see and what is this this is the midwest were trending down i can select these two points on the chart here and i can see you know what i want to do a company feature analyze which is our automated insights engine and what itll do is itll do a comparative analysis between point a and point b down here and itll say what led to this change or what would the attributes of factors that may have caused us to go down and what itll do is itll account executive a pin board for me that will show me the the results of that that analysis on the click up here spanish queue this is the one we just ran and you can see first it showed me that my total drive from q  q q  was down  percent and then these are the contributing factors to that so these are the  stores out of my  stores is that the states im out of my  products these  cars the greatest with squash we prepared and for us pizza havent gone down the most but the point is its kind of showing you other areas to look other insights that you want to focus on and to get more detail what actually happened we saw that there was a trend down why did that happen promises the startup showing you what that is and ive mentioned a number of times our ai engines that we have under the covers getting smarter over time this is one that takes feedback as well so by like an insight i can give her a thumbs up that way it knows later on that you know maybe i like to look at information by stores if its something thats not interesting and give him a thumbs down itll asked me what wasnt meaningful was it a particular state store state in general and itll wait that heavier next time it generates new insights for crowdsourcing thing where not only itll take my feedback but ill take feedback from others as well and and rank that feedback appropriately  company feature ends  client  yeah well what is the trying to do here because its got you know some of them and color or some of them kind of gray obviously its trying to pull attention to certain attributes but its not necessarily even though you know top  across the most impactful across the board or theres no clear delineated line between those particular bar charts its just like heres the the three out of the six thats worse  company feature  systems engineer  right so yeah its its going to be based on so theres different settings and now that you can turn to to to get what you want to stand out and based on that at all either the talents will be higher where itll show you many more things but in this case here its just showing you the the the ones that stand out the most  company feature ends  systems engineer  and im not exactly sure what what the threshold is it could be  percent right like this ones nine point nine eight and then this ones over  is that thatsfine turned blue so im not exactly sure what the exact you know we could tweak with those numbers to see how our change  company feature  systems engineer  now this is just a one simple analysis its a comparative analysis theres other analysis that we do as well if i come back to this chart as well instead of doing that comparative analysis i could have hit this lightbulb here and in this case itll do other algorithms instead of a comparative analysis for all do outlier detection trend analysis cross correlation analysis again i can set these different threshold and ill just let that run it will take a little bit longer than the last one but youll see a totally different rendering where its showing you outliers is showing you how metrics correlate its showing you different spikes and trends and things like that  data architecture  systems engineer  so those are all out of the box algorithms theres nothing that that you really have to do to get them to work its just automatic in the system any any other questions on account executive  i was just gonna do a quick time check weve got about  minutes left so maybe we can jump into how we would go connect to something like data bricks or or third party vendor and building out the semantic layer  pinboard  systems engineer  yep sure so lets lets do that so im gonna come up here to the to the data tab company employee  one last question before you jumped from the connections can reschedule that dashboard or like a scheduler daily weekly frequency like email out or systems engineer  gmail out yeah yeah so you can set up a schedule where a pdf can be emailed out to two users into in terms of the you know the the data every time a person just connects to its going to be the most recent data as a sitting in the in the data warehouse data architecture  systems engineer  but yeah absolutely you can you can send out static versions of it okay so the so im in the data tab here this is where a lot of the work goes on by the data and on the store the data administer or to set up those worksheets that are users then has available to them  data management  functions  systems engineer  so the first thing im gonna do is probably just a a two step process create a connection select the tables that you want and then create a worksheet so add a new connection here and scott systems engineer third party vendor and well just connect to third party vendor you can see the different databases that we connect you there and ill just connect to a service account that we have  data architecture  client  that was that the full list of connections possible thats built somehow okay yep so it doesnt connect to like third party vendor for example in those for those types of cloud applications systems engineer  no what we do is and were in the process now of building out something that we call spot at which are prebuilt applications for various systems like third party vendor like service now where theres a process to move the data from those underlying technologies into your on your database of choice  pinboard  systems engineer  and then we have this prebuilt content that includes work prebuilt worksheets and pre prebuilt live boards that you install and hadnt automatically created application but but yeah those are the data sources that we connected we dont connect to application sources click continue here okay so here all the tables of data this is that i have access to data management  functions  systems engineer  ill just pick a small one down here called retail apparel to another retail data set but its smaller than the one we just looked at fact table into dimension tables and i can just come in here and pick which tables and which fields i want to expose to company so i dont have to bring any all of them in if theres some that i dont want to expose to company i would just not not check those and then when i click this create connection button a couple of things one it will start reading in the met a data  data management  functions ends  systems engineer  so the tables the fields the data types it will build that out in in company and then the second thing thats gonna do is start that tokenization process so when i start searching on the search bar you suddenly do earlier thats happening right now when we you know create this initial connection  data management  functions  systems engineer  and then whats the connections created the next thing we wanna do is put the relationships in so if theres if your primary foreign key relationships have not been defined within the underlying database you would set up the relationships and then you said about the task of building a worksheet so as an example here are the three tables that i brought in if i click on this particular table here is where the analysts we really start setting things up i can come up period of joins and joins were already defined in this database so i dont have to define them here but if i needed to i would just say i want to add a join and select where i want to add the joined too but we dont need to do that so right now what i can do is i can start building out a worksheet i can start against these tables but what ill do is create a worksheet that all then share with end users for them to to start searching so ill say create a worksheet and again this is the met a data layer does come down and pick those tables that i brought in so theres a dimension tables in fact table  data management  functions ends  systems engineer  and then its a matter of deciding which fields i want to include in this worksheet so ill say i want to bring product name product type i want to bring in a store name stage the county region ill leave lat lawn out so again its a subset dont need all the tables i dont need all these ids because those are just artifacts of the ships ill bring those in and then i can also add some formulas in here as well if i want to you know put it in a formula i dont know lets just say i want to some sales you know im just making something up here right but theres a whole host of formulas that you can put in here and you can see quantity purchase etcetera if you are familiar with formulas in excel or are you familiar with formulas and other we have some pass through formulas conversion formulas etcetera youre familiarwith excel or other bi tools you can easily build formulas here as well now we just give it a name well say client  is formula as are pushed down via sequel or is that creating a city company engine systems engineer  theyre all pushed out the sql so let me save that and then the last thing i wanna do is really what we call make it search ready make it more friendly right so ill just change some of the names so product product type you get the point right quantity things like that i can put synonyms and so ive got sales here but maybe i dont want to call it sales i want to call it revenue as an example ive got a state i want to gl code that state so im just kind of setting this up making it what we call search ready for users so you would just go about doing this you know a lot of times youll have a much larger theres just a simple example save the changes and then shared shared off with the groups of users so just come in here and i would say okay this worksheet i now want to share it with all groups particular groups you know maybe the south region i can give them permission to edited or just view it and then thats it so now when i come over here to my my search button rather than looking at retail sales i now have another source here instead of just retail sales and theres a lot of work sheets in here because its a demo instance but i can get get rid of that and lets say whats the name of it  data drill down  systems engineer  i called it systems engineer retail right there heres the one that i just created and its ready for me to go in and i can say i wanna look at my revenue i want to look at it by state and i want to look at it by last year as an example no data found so theres i think theres some old data in here so as i said its revenue by monthly as an example i didnt have to do anything from a just because i have a date in here right automatically i have all this date functionality i want to look at it next month i want to look at it weekly so i didnt have to create metrics that each one of these different levels drill down so automatically appear i can see you know what i want to drill down by store name right so theres no hierarchy is i had to define on a drill down by product  pinboard  systems engineer  this is all just automatic based on creating that worksheet and you know to the point we talked about earlier this is coming from a different data source but i want to pin this to my dashboard now if we go back and look is there a dashboard that i created a great first i did that explore on that initial dashboard i went in and took what was on an existing dashboard and put it on mine as well i did somesearches and added it to my dashboard you can see they all had this explore button heres all the drill downs i did and heres the the most recent one and these are all live and i can click this explore button and what kind of going full circle now right i can i want to filter on either hell as an example or i want to add in other fields and state or et cetera okay any any questions on that no we flew through that really really fast  data management  functions  company employee  good question on the worksheet side you can still have multiple tables coming from multiple scheme us within the same database by topic quitting from there did i can still have tables coming from multiple user space systems engineer  in in a worksheet its from a single connection company employee  so if the connections based on  days you can have tables from two different absolutely thank you much bye okay  data management  functions ends  systems engineer  yes absolutely yep systems engineer  any other questions client  so does it handle or alert to places where you might build something that causes duplicates systems engineer  it give me example what what youre referring to by duplicates client  so maybe youve got a transaction out there you know set of transactions right and i dont know maybe theres some came from codes and things like that there could be some table that list that transaction five different times because it came through different systems engineermarketing keywords and things like that right and when you try to join those together if you were to try to get to the revenue out of thattransaction it would be you know five acts of what it actually is  removed order guide times right because this guy file some attribute on  pricing  systems engineer  right right so you you you think its a one too many and its actually a many to many client  yeah because it does those one systems engineer   client  keep things there and yeah exactly and then and you end up using your your senior track  removed transaction now all of a sudden it shows is  removed right because its joined to  data management  functions  systems engineer  right client  right whatever attribute does does it handle that does it or do you have to kinda systems engineer  thats client  thats systems engineer  handled by yeah the usual data quality or i mean it can be our data quality is there but then also just your your qa of of the reporting infrastructure you know making sure that youre not getting those duplicate accounts and things like that no i i will say that one of the things that we do really well that that bi tools dont do is whenever you have multiple fact tables theres always the situationespecially when youre creating calculations between that you can get these chasm trap said duplicate counting that youre referring to client  right systems engineer  and we handle out of the box these cant chasm drops what we dont do that duplicate accounting and we also handled fan traps as well what you typically see in a order header type schemer as well so you know automatically yeah we do we do do some of that stuff but not certainly and every every situation kind of the the way youre referring to it i know were almost at

low,lost,about company,company employee  ive been in analytics my whole career so im going on maybe my eighteenth or nineteenth year now and i started as an analyst like most people do and analytics side either built on our supported business objects crystal reports and third party vendorstrategy back in the mid  move down to deploy click was in the third party vendor ecosystem four or five years and helped bring third party vendor online and then i joined company as an se as a sales engineer in  so well i guess one that i miss sorry it was a director of analytics i also sold and deployed maybe  different customers across either third party vendor third party vendor or third party vendor depending on the department of the software account executive  that with a company employee  company that i worked for so in my new role here at company it actually makes sense that i kind of head up our competitive intelligence team and basically i just get to share all the stories that id be there learn throughout my career or that i get communicated to me from our existing customers because company see a unique company in a way that where other bi vendors have started departmental small you know maybe im thinking about click i used out a server under my desk basically just for the sales team third party vendor was very easy to start with  users you know and grow it over time and then third party vendor was kind have an interesting thing where it was really focused on the mid systems engineeret right smaller deploy and then its not really ready are compmarketing against your scp is your third party vendors so anyway whereas other vendors kinda started small departmental and grew as they are you know over time company decided to enter the systems engineeret from the enterprise level down which was a very bold goal  search types  company employee  some of the first things that they architected it was for speed and scale and complex data model so those are the three tenets that they really wanted to you know establish the company on so in launching an enterprise you know youreyoure immediately dealing with potentially thousands of users a lot of concurrency single sign on row level security issues there  pricing  company employee  or you know things that needs to be addressed and then after that became the scale of of the actual data itself right so were talking up at the time it was in the terabytes of data and now were approaching the i dont know i think our largest deployment might be  plus terabytes of data in production but they actually search on every day  about company  company employee  that would be who by the way so anyway its an interesting thing of kind of memarketing in the middle and compmarketing against some other tools that are really trying to continue to grow when we created an established a great reputation for ourselves from you know from the largest customers so my reason and going through that almost every enterprise level customer that we have today also owns client  rbi third party vendor company employee  click third party vendorstrategy you know the list goes on and on so my role is interesting that i get to sit right in the middle i do a lot of road map sessions for existing customers and i spend a lotta time with our customers getting feedback and helping to drive the road map  about company ends  company employee  so part of the question and i often will go through is what what is your landscape look like today tell me about your architecture or what other tools that you have in house and probably most importantly why did you decide to buy company after owning several other analytics tools so some of that information that ill share with you today any questions about that background where to get started about company  client  no thank you thats thats the postcards introduction to get to your presentation make so lets go ahead company employee  great so lets see i i understand that you guys also own several of the tools that ive mentioned so whats third party vendor third party vendor in third party vendor being the primary too client  third party vendor and third party vendorstrategy locally yeah client  yeah company yeah i mean in terms of user adoption that blue in spotfire around the the the bracket okay and we do have cleanses im showing off third party vendorstrategy and bobby and second use cases but when i stepped in spotfire and have white list pick okay company employee  okay great so i can i can speak to all four of those and what ill do is this is just a conversation you know i i dont need to continue selling you this is something that i think its important to know just how we kinda fit in the systems engineeret and theres a reason that we typically dont start with the kind of language of saying we can displace all these other tools right  search types  company employee  because i think theres a really good fit of where some users will grab take towards the easy button right being company being like a natural language search it feels a little bit more like third party vendor it personalizes itself over time and gets to know the end user and so its very familiar right weve architected it to feel like turning on who lou or adjusting removed right where its very personalized for just you and its making smarter recommendations for that very reason we probably see the highest adoption rates from a user base than any other tool ive ever used and so we we actually monitor that when customers will allow us to  about company  company employee  it kind of its just a ping home letting us know when people are logging in or just you know stats over time and were seeing really great adoption rates which i think is a huge success factor for many customers who are buying a new tool we suffer in the industry as a whole through for user adoption and you know if you follow gartner stats they went from about  percent user adoption maybe three years ago up to about  to  percent today is what theyre measuring and theyattributed company is one of the higher ranking wants to pull that entire in three step up when we became a later in the magic quadrant a couple of years ago we really should things up with search it was a brand new concept and of course that means that all the other major players had to add that feature they had no choice a new comer in the systems engineeret gaining a lot of traction gaining popularity getting great reviews  search types  company employee  they had to add a search bar another functionality so third party vendor has asked data third party vendor has q and a third party vendorstrategy has insights you know theres just everyone has started to add this natural language kind have idea unfortucompany employeely its not as easy as just throwing a search bar on an old architecture  data management  functions  company employee  thought so i had to be built from the ground up and our founders started with some of the publicly available free you know free where almost a crowd source tools like around the hindu apache kind of architecture trying to achieve better scale through things that were semi structured data and they still werent fast enough  data architecture  company employee  so we ended up having to build our own in memory engine this is just a little bit of background and kind of help you guys you know frame of you know frame this conversation as we started moving into a cloud first architecture weve noticed that theres the players that kind of boil to the top that become the premier data providers and a lot of the modern cloud data warehouses have really started beefing up their architecture so much that now we can use live query we call it embrace to instead of bringing data in memory like you have too many other tools creating an extract and third party vendor committing data and the memory for third party vendor allocating resources buying or pro licenses whatever that happens to be for third party vendor now with company its simply connect to your data and query live so we send out the sequel query it executes on the system of record your cloud data warehouse or wherever your data happens to exist in a return the results and a couple of seconds you guys are probably already familiar with us im just gonna you know it just again it will help frame the conversation for later and of course weve had enormous success with that approach because the less data you have to move the better right so as we move into a star burst world and some of the more forward thinking ways of working with data it just becomes easier than ever to connect choose your tables very lightly model that data for search and then just give it to the end user right,0.9997,0.158,0.013,0.829
low,lost,about company,company employee  i think theres always the idea of starting with they dashboard or a pin board first so that there was a foundation which is good but then allowing true add hawk analysis allowing true selfservice is something that we do much better than any other tool ive ever used in my career  industry issues  company employee  and thats the kind of thing that we hear from our existing customers is we might reserve third party vendor for our pixel perfect dashboards that are analyst driven and you know built and then deployed out for others to consume and then well use company for everything else right selfservice add hawk analysis just getting a quick answer  agenda  company employee  and yeah thats kind of where weve ended up today i hope thats helpful a little bit before we kind of go into some of the more intricate details you know kind of comparing and contrasting anything else you guys would like to client  come out today okay good thank you that helps so  agenda ends  client  you said that you work with some clients to walk them through the adoption of pop spot gave me the deck this is something thats good tell me more about the challenges that you face you know throughout that whole adoption journey and how did we change that mindset chain that account shirts i mean that to me is going to be the hardest company employee okay i as i as i look at the adoption in beauty yeah because if i put my cell thats too right i am using third party vendor is doing well you know for me now if you asked me to reschedule my team right you better have a really good reason and make me see the clio benefits right now theyll get me wrong we do have some individuals in the organization right that we have so with removed to some of them will jump on that okay but its very rare right as you know to have people that has an open client that can see the value of the two right away without without a lot of you know hand holding okay the maturity of the community is going to be resistant to get out that comfort zone to change of mindset and thats very human nature right so understanding the chat and choose how you label to overcome that when you work with funds would help us better so about company  company employee  yeah i would say that you know changing that that focus that frame of mind its something weve had to do when selling our own software as well because were coming at the systems engineeret very differently than everyone else almost every other tool is built for the analyst or the data engineer  about company ends  company employee  maybe people who would they came up through university and our cs program and and were top data and analytics from a free version of third party vendor and what kind of comes with that is this odd feeling of quite of ownership navy is what i will call it its the idea that ive built this right  industry issues  company employee  so analyst are very defensive about tools that they know and own and theyre resistant to change even though they may complain to each other on a weekly basis about how busy they are about each new request that comes through the frustrating part so ive answered that question five times before why are you asking me again having to build yet another report with just the tiniest little tweak these are all things that are kind of frustrating to the analytics teams but they dont know anything different right its just what theyre used to doing with company we try to refrain the conversation into why people want better selfservice made it so that they lets lets use a business user as an example the business user wants to maybe come in ask a question get an answer and move on about their day everyday business users dont live in the analytics world they want some proof to validate a hunch using data right so that they can make a better business decision or they want to discover something that they didnt know before you know kind of have that aha moment that helps to make them better at their jobs and so complex dashboards can be overwhelming for the everyday business user they have to remember which dashboard to go to how to navigate right  industry issues ends  company employee  slicing and dicing and drilling down and the more complicated dashboard is the harder it is for them to do that or you know imagine something that you havent logged into in the last three weeks you might forget your password you might have to kind of refund you know familiar side familiarize yourself with the ui again these are every day struggles that kind have hinder user adoption the things that add onto it and make it more painful for the business user is if a dashboard is slow to render and they have to wait to to three minutes they probably get him patient walk away get a cup of coffee pick up their phone start looking at facebook whatever it happens to be and over time they will just lose interest it becomes alittle bit of an annoyance right and so they just kinda stopped using it weve tried to tackle all of those through new features that have been added for the analyst so in selling over to an analytics team theres a few things that we do to help them retain that sense of ownership but also to make it easier for them to give a selfservice environment that theyre actually comfortable with  industry issues  company employee  because what were hearing from the search bar of other tools thats not quite ready for prime time quite honestly we hear about it from our data and third party vendor and queue and from power all the time of it can create more confusion than its worth if people are asking the question and it produces an inaccurate result the wrong answer thats detrimental youre done youre dead in the water right  about company  company employee  they lose confidence and they move on so with a lot of our customers that have tried to roll out those new features theyve actually pulled it back out of production because they its just to a mature right and company it gets thrown into that bucket more often than i would like to say because when someone thinks with third party vendor cant do it this book payments in the industry or third party vendor cant do it then company surely cant do it any better than they can but the biggest differences those tools are analyst driven account executive for dashboards and were search first all weve done is focus on search since we created the product eight years ago and now we are starting to beef up all the features that an analyst will enjoy or a data engineer will actually appreciate of things that they had to create workarounds in the other tool,0.9994,0.158,0.041,0.8
low,lost,company product,company employee  so ill take a i use third party vendor as an example for this one when youre creating the extract and third party vendor they recommend a single fact table with a couple of other you know dimensional tables connected and then that extract is committed to memory so its very simple data model and anytime that you need to model multiple fact tables into an extract things become extremely client  if i call company employee  you have to write custom sequel to do it you have to do a couple of workarounds and unfortunatly it just brings the third party vendor server down to a crawl itcan really slow down the performance company was just naturally built for many too many joins across multiple fact tables  search types  company employee  so what that really means is sales and markmarketing data sets can be put together sales and inventory can be put together and people can ask more complex questions using an easy interface like search and the data just generate the answer in a couple of seconds its something thats truly unique  search types ends  company employee  so once an analyst or a data engineer realizes how much easier it is to model data and a worksheet and then just give that that more complete data set user much higher success rates are starting to happen because of that alone some of the other things that weve added in recently we call one feature search assist this is the idea of when we onboard a brand new user they receive an email and it takes them through its three step process of the ai familiarizing itself or personalization so what data sets have you been granted access to see who are other users in your social group  pinboard  company employee  maybe like your analyst or other peers that you want to follow its kind of like a social engineering aspect and then what metrics do you care about more than others and not all the other metrics will get dropped out its just that it will bring these more important metrics to the top  search types  company employee  so that free personalized homepage experience which is already an enormous benefit after that searches this is a feature for analyst inside a worksheet that they can create the starting questions that will teach an end user without having to go through a classroom setting every time so its an automated process that says welcome to company heres your new homepage experience data drill down  company employee  these are the data sets you have access to heres the most popular reports and dashboards and then if you want to start try search its gonna take you through stepbystep process of okay what we see you have access to this sales data set you can ask questions like sales by region monthly and it will actually ask them to type those words out and then itll you know create a trend line for them showing that regions trending over time and so anyway you can add as many questions as you want and that acts as a personalized training for each dataset,0.9947,0.123,0.01,0.867
low,lost,onboarding,company employee  no matter which group or user you add into that data set so our goal there is trying to replace the classroom setting that constant back and forth training of an end user of time to re familiarize a new user and so thats something that weve heard from our customers that actually really moves the needle  industry issues  company employee  it its been an enormously helpful thing for them because in any analytics tool you may want to roll it out to a large user group but its very hard to do about one on one training every time and thats an enormous time suck you know for the for the analyst for the data team,-0.642,0.035,0.061,0.904
low,lost,company product,account executive  okay so client  wow did you work with you know any client through the whole adoption journey company employee and then heres lets just say i want to lets just assume for a second right i mean i talked to account executive a lot and hes been extremely helpful and and having this memarketing with you in a way second my understanding as well  about company  client  i am a strong believer in the valley you know off top spot you wouldnt want to have to see right and then compare that with others company employee  sureclient  but i thats the thing that i want to see that were going to struggle with as where we adopt company as a follow in get the buy in from the organization  about company ends  client  alright it will be easy easy if i could just go to people and say hey guys stop what youre doing move here and thats it no discussion but thats not how it works okay thats not how it works anywhere right i got to you know walk the business through the whole journey right and then get the buy in you know it has to be in the middle where do it well yeah well and people will calm right yup and grow with that population style small grow that population s people are gonna youre gonna see the value of this but im gonna see the ss struggle export and the new adoption and group right good hes enough and you know right lets just say company is better than third party vendor okay for show the use cases but if people do not see this those do not see that the benefits gonna from inconvenience for them to switch from third party vendor the company that i say well so what you know i can just stay away im right now im the guy to see the rabbit right so that whole adoption journey is going to be challenging nothing hospice capability right whatsoever capacity third party vendor full force with the use cases this because its really hard to change peoples from my side the culture so what i do want to understand from you company employee is how did it work out for other organization right you know what take me did you you know work with the ultimately the other client to go through this journey and make it as smooth as we go forward account executive  okay company employee  its been interesting as weve grown over the last couple of years that when our customers continue to expand into new departments or you know bringing in more data than ever giving more users to it weve been very surprised at how much more organic growth that happens simply because of looking over someone else to shoulder and seeing a new tool being very easy to use the most common thing we hear all the time as well what is that that youre using can i get access to that client  okay thats company employee  always kind of surprise me but thats just because its you know its new its fresh it it is by far easier than anything else the next most common thing is using company live in memarketings and im not sure how much you remember i can show it if youd like,0.9979,0.18,0.031,0.79
low,lost,company product,company employee  but when youre in a pin board or a dashboard its always live right so we have presentation mode which will go full screen it looks like powerpoint and in a memarketing or someone ask a question you can right click you can drill down you can ask your question  industry issues  company employee  you can actually get to the root of that answer which is vastly different than other where you have to perhaps maybe go back and build something or an analyst is sitting over the over to the side and the memarketing scrambling trying to create something very fast you know before the memarketings over it happens with customers like lets say if you know name add has company and youre someone is on with one of their your customers and lets say its like an invoice and you can pull up that invoice and see its current status you know shipping levels  industry issues ends  company employee  you can pull up any details so people can answer a question immediately that becomes addictive you know what right people love getting that what do we call that that  search types  company employee  instant gratification but the other thing that you shouldnt discount is that that pride of ownership i mentioned earlier for an analyst also happens for the business user so when a business user is talk very simply how to search and theyre able to ask and answer their own questions theyre kinda proud of what theyve done  agenda  company employee  it sounds trivial but it works very well so what we often will show in training or what youll hear from our customer success and if you dont mind im going to share my screen real quick and ill just do one very very basic example of that the this is something go ahead go ahead pinboard  client  no no no i mean go ahead on the shed sleepless nights company employee  yeah can you guys see a pin board or a dashboard here my homepage client  yes i can okay company employee  okay so this is just the starting point again its already been personalized for me and my log in this is just what i described earlier popularity right  search types  company employee  things that are updating all the time so if someone comes to you and ask a question im gonna use the the smart homepage here for a second by the way this toggle that just happened when its on this left side this is what we call search answers basically it means searching through all the content thats already built  data drill down  company employee  this one is called search data and it is like i want to ask a question from the ground up off of the data set that ive been you know granted access to see so what im gonna do is search a prebuilt answer ill use something generic someone comes to me and says you know what were sales by product type last year because im trying to decide what were going to roll out this year as a comparative thing so maybe we want to do this year versus last year okay well lets see and imagine someones watching over my shoulder well let me just show you how you can ask that question you know would you asked me what were sales by product type in  and ask it a natural language okay so heres the dashboards that you have access to see right sales by product type is in bold it kind of highlighted that for you its a translated  two last year because its smart enough to do so is this kind of what youre looking for okay yeah thats it  data drill down ends  company employee  alright well you can do that very easily you saw how i did it but lets go ahead and go to that because the next most common thing is going to happen is whats your next question right so what its doing right now is its actually usingthat ai to personalize this based off of anything that i happened to have searched in my past,0.9978,0.134,0.022,0.844
low,lost,company product,company employee  so this one takes generally three two five seconds to open because of the personalization so well give this a second its taking a little bit longer than normal but as an example i just moved to city from state this month and so i used to search you know state a lot where you can see that thats down here right on the right  data drill down  company employee  so if i wanted to just select on one particular like kinda hot button then it will automatically add that filter now an end user can continue asking the next question right if they want to see this broken down by each individual products the reason im taking you guys through this is if someones watching over my shoulder everything im showing you should look so easy that people get the feeling of all my gosh i can do that all you did was ask a question and natural language you selected a filter that are presented to you you write clicked anywhere to drill down at any time because the analysts does add to prebuilt any hierarchies and then if you want to continue adding things like you know this one i happened to add the quantity purchased as well  pinboard  company employee  if this is the answer the someone wants then of course they can go on about their day share it say client  at whatever company employee  okay thats one of those like over the shoulder training moments that people will want to go and explore data on their own because again it was easy its kinda familiar et cetera now if i get rid of this and go back to the pin board what i mentioned earlier was the live mode so if if you were to talk to someone like some of our other life sciences companiesname  it actually is a great example name uses company and all of their live memarketings now and when it goes full screen like this youre presenting of course someones gonna ask a question but at any time again you can continue working with that you know you can right clickand drill down at any moment answering that question on the fly and you know we just kinda it helps to foster adoption from the ground up  search types  company employee  so im answering your question and kind of have a long winded way saying weve weve built the product so that the ui kinda helps false per user adoption this is also something that we use to disarm everyday business users and to not overwhelmed them right all the concepts that we show are very simple our our pin boards may not be as overly complex looking as you know third party vendor as an example or third party vendor you have to go through multiple pages to kinda get to it it can kinda get a little bit lost we tried to architect ours is more like a natural a web page kinda like third party vendor results except its off your data and all of this is factual answers,0.9967,0.139,0.015,0.846
low,lost,onboarding,company employee  its not like okay heres  results pick the one that you think is best so thats probably the the biggest starting point for user adoption and our cs team you know there are two kinds of support you along the way they have so many tips and tricks and things that theyve learned from other customers some of it is very light classroom style training some of it is a video tutorials so i happened to be on the technical product systems engineermarketing team we often will produce videos that are kind have like tutorial commercial type training videos but its off of your environment with your live company instance that you share internally  onboarding process ends  company employee  its completely for you the who is there an enormously successful internally because you can always say hey if youre were going to give you access to company start here watch this first and thats another you know really really really nice feature client  sure any questions company employee  football i know im talkingclient  a lot no i think i think this is good and just so you know right and then these are the thing that account executive mock they have also share with us as well right so we kind of have a good idea on this now let me ask you one one more question company employee as you walk us through that you know im thinking about steel right onboarding process client how do we convince the business to adopters okay and while the thing that you know we normally do to convince the business or anything based understand that pain points okay and so the that hey with the adoption of this new technology youll pain point is kinda go away,0.974,0.136,0.074,0.79
low,lost,company product, yeah were not gonna introduce any new pinpoint for you all right now and then and then id be working with account executive and systems engineer i hear it all the call to come up with a list of pain point that company can result for you know you show slow using third party vendor today so we kind of have an idea right but i want to i want to hear from you yeah based on your real life experience as you go and you work with the business when you sell this to them what other pain points that youre him to resolve them that make them jump on this one lets just say people who use third party vendor okaycompany employee yeah so i will actually just kinda go through a list this is actually pretty easy to do so when i work with my with all of our existing customers and ill try and refine this to other biotech life sciences customers if i go through like our again medtronic buyer add those couple of that just kind of come to mind industry issues company employee they would also on both third party vendor and third party vendor some of the quotes that i often wall here is you know our business doesnt see third party vendor is truly selfservice right were always dependent on the technical team deliver each new add hawk request weve been working with ill just im actually gonna read off a couple of quotes i cant really share them with you but i will read them off for you third party vendor doesnt give our business what what they want is to technical theres too much back and forth for request and our analyst are always currently involved our biggest problem is not being able to hire enough analyst to support every i add hawk request so we were looking for a better answer thats actually a pretty good thats pretty common one ad hoc requests could take a week just to get us back and answer by time that weve gotten an answer the business already moved on people who already made their decision and the reports too late industry issues ends company employee so it goes on years so the reason i kinda read through those is thats kinda helping with that whole like we we play very friendly with the other tools we might be complimentary we dont have to replace anything so i think you know as youve got your existing analytics teams but still want to own and support third party vendor in third party vendor is of the world the business might be craving a better answer industry issues company employee they might want to solve that problem that pain point that you mentioned and so i think what comes along with that is a very natural you know what if there were a better way what if i show you an easier way that you can ask and answer your own question and you dont have to wait a week for eight another dashboard or  another and youre probably never going to get a no to that answer people are always going to be interested you know they may not want to go and ask the analyst every time i know from experience that a lot of my old my business users would be very hesitant to ask more questions because they always thought they were bothering me right even though i would always say no thats what im here for this my job anytime you have a question come in and ask it i may not be able to answer it immediately and it may take me a while to get to your answer because i got you know other requests that have already been asked this week but again you know please continue to ask industry issues ends company employee so these are kind of some of the things that you can do too help to to change those hearts and minds of people that might be a little bit more resistant but what i mentioned off earlier was well the you know the tool might be too technical for me to use you know meaning third party vendor or third party vendor i always have to go to the analyst my wait time is frustrating and all i wanna do is get a sample answer it cant be that difficult well thats why we model our data for search so that when we add synonyms when we add new you know calculations or measures that are in the language of the end user that were enabling them to do it themselves search types company employee it does take a little bit of a change and the way that they think about it especially internal analytics teams but i always remind people of when you want to look for something on netflix you might search right or if you want to look up anything ever you third party vendor it if you need to find a quick product you go into you search it on third party vendor these are all things that are very familiar and peoples every daylives and weve modeled company off of those user end user tools those commercial search features and so it should feel very familiar to them which will probably mean they continue to to adopt it and use it more than anything else that you have makes search types ends account executiveclient makes sense makes sense thank you company employee i think that that that and so again to my question and this is very much in alignment with the pain point that we work in you know one reason i mean theaccount executiveclient one thing that you know that that come to my mind is as to talk about that is in our list of pain point we talk a lot about number one improving the speed to insight right industry issues client without a whole back and forth communication between the business use her and the data analyst right and also all of that help us we do is you know the empty and the time it takes to be a dashboard right with resolving cost cost savings for us yeah but we do wanna but i know day when you really think about that right the the the the team the you the dashboard they couldnt care less about this because hey whatever dashboard that the you know they asked to be theyd be to

low,lost,customer base,clientaccount executiveclient have theres probably two ways to answer that question so we have an application we sell client yup all that data is in our production databases and up until for the first eight years up until now its been in our production databases customers get it out for reporting through like stored procedures in the last two years we leverage and as your data warehouse we didnt love it but it worked data architecture client and then it powered our third party vendor bi instance and then in the last six two nine months weve migrated from is your data or house over to third party vendor so third party vendor is relatively new for us there is a newer project to power like customer private data links and then it also power some of our bi but most of our bi stuff like if you take lets say qualtrics or jeera data or third party vendor data goes directly to third party vendor because we didnt yeah we dont have a big benefit data engineering team to route it properly through third party vendor data management  functions client so its the long game is that everything would live in our data warehouse but its its a maturity timeline that were onaccount executive okay gotcha so for our jeera third party vendor did it youre taking that data or youre extracting it then putting it into into third party vendorclient so our our our proper flow is that we use an extraction tool called stitch offered by of talent data architecture client and then that feeds to our data warehouse and third party vendor and then depending on the team like if its data science they primarily use data from third party vendor if its like the bi tools we use mostly some from third party vendor but we have yet to read pipe quality tricks snow third party vendor and other apps like a sign up over into the warehouse they go straight to third party vendor for an okay okay data architecture ends account executiveclient im guessing for you guys that all make sense yep ill get all that for you guys getting a normal language,0.9966,0.187,0.031,0.782
low,lost,customer base,account executive yep totally get it let me do this so before i even get it let me ask you this too its kinda company employee guess that maybe a loaded question besides you wearing you know multiple different hats and maybe he said lack of sleep in the last couple of months have you like is there a specific challenge at kinda sticks out from your current analytics processes or something its like you do lose sleep overclientaccount executive like hey i want to fix this or whats kind of top of mind when when you hear that questionclient i answer both from the analytic side and the roadmap side from the analytic side up until this last month our main problem was twofold throughput and just analyst to to tackle projects we have a great plan a good set of tools and a good process that is working and its well respected at the company so its more of a head count and throughput and then also now argued engineering team has become our bottleneck so to connect to other apps there now helping other teams so they just dont give us the attendee and the speed so thats on the analytic side and on the web apps to side theyre just  apps do like  were never fully implemented data management  functions client so the data is not really good so something like no one else can solve but also its like actually implementing getting solid data but we dont have i dont feel like we have some of the classic type problems of like cant analyzer stay data were doing pretty well like we have some pretty solid analysts pretty solid work pump out research every month have a pattern of process so a lot of that stuff so were actually working,0.9911,0.189,0.037,0.774
low,lost,about company, data management  functions ends account executive okay so throughput almost as like a head count resourcesclient but we fix fix so we just hired three people that start between july and august so thats going to actually change by november okay thanks for thataccount executiveclient yep product analytics were doing really well in comparison to two years ago like we didnt have instrumentation we didnt know what things do and now we have every single thing in our product is instrumented tracks charted trend analysis like if you want to talk about that we can look up every little button like whats going on and themes and we need to researchaccount executive okay yeah product analytics is a strong use case for for a lot of our customers systems engineer and i actually working with removed right now within their check out and product analytics team were connected directly to about removed removed of data where theyre actually enabling their product managers to be able to to understand whats driving conversion data drill down account executive id be able to quickly identify hey show me conversion six months ago with crypto versus you know last month on mobile devices in state for people agent  to  for example like just like they can type that in natural language and show answers instantly and kind of to your point with their data engineers data drill down ends account executive that was there bottleneck before i started working with us so theyve actually created this dataset and almost enabled the product managers with their own playground essentially yeah here you go go at it so its increase speed insights obviously and drive conversion so we can show you that but let me let me walkthrough just a quick overview have a few slides about company account executive i think its important to understand just kinda picture the challenge that were really solving because company client we are we are a bi you know i guess in the bi and analytics you know space of course but we solve for different problem compare to some of the traditional tools like third party vendor third party vendor for example search types account executive so let me let me walkthrough this a little bit im sorry my nieces so couple of things so the the number one thing to take company is we are built from search so our founders client or seven of them actually came from third party vendor and being backgrounds and so they wanted to bring a consumer like expense its like when we have questions that are personal life when you go to third party vendor and ask it and get an answer instantly they want to bring that to the enterprise so search you ask a question and natural language you get answers instantly is one piece of our technology and then the second piece client is we have an ai engine built into our tool company feature account executive we call it company feature its actually as a business user who has no technical background can run analysis clicking company feature and it basically will surface anomalies or trends that are engineers catching and well surface those to the top so for your business users or product analytics sometimes knowing the question to ask is the hardest part will ask those questions and surface those insights fruit or then you can start your analysis from there about company account executive so we can show you both of these but those are the two kind of main you know differentiators in our product or the two technologies that scott us to grow as fast as youre seeing here right i know you client is really well you know large round of funding were valued at a little over removed removed data architecture account executive now third party vendor actually just recently invested in us as well third party vendors also a customer of ours we are growing fast we work across all of industry so i can ill share some use cases as we go through this but really what were what were solving and i think its actually a good timing for what youre going through right now because it sounds like you have the traditional data warehouse right and youre moving to is modern cloud anywhere else in the third party vendor no matter how good third party vendor is and how a modern is an elegant its a great tool and great product but still accessing data in third party vendor remains a challenge and its not just for your data engineers analysts right but you give me a third party vendor account or any rev ops team you gave him one of your sales reps are third party vendor account like i imagine they have no idea what to do with it rightclient yeah i dont i dont have to beat that at all like its a data warehouse alright not purpose built for like getting answers its purpose built for organizing information industry issues account executive right so but what were what were trying to change and you told me it sounds like this might be similar to what youre doing where you have your data right you know one of your data sources or for example maybe youre cuban aggregating that data and then you put it into some type of report or a dashboard and then you push it out to the business pushed out to the sales team to the systems engineer team right finance its this is traditionally what weve seen our customers and you know this can take some time and half the time when you get it to the financial the sales team what happens next i mean the dashboard right they have another question and it goes to this ever ending loop of can you make me a new view or new dashboard is that sound familiar industry issues ends client yeah i dont have to beta i think were so we cant ignore like we didnt have like three years ago we didnt have like they need a data problem now we have a much bigger problems like this this this may this relates to where we areaccount executive yeah okay industry issues account executive and so what were what were trying to do is really compliment like you know less dashboards and more answers so rather than a static dashboard how do we flip the paradigm completely upside down what were trying to do then client is flip that paradigm that i showed you and actually net out this imagine this purple circle here is like about company systems engineeraccount executive a third party vendor for example your third party vendor data enabling the business units to ask questions directly we we we just rolled this out and removed a few months ago like within two and a half months three months they have  business users using thoughts daily asking questions or third party vendor right about company ends account executive freeing up their bi team and enabling them through some of their selfservice do their own insights so well well show you that and i think whats really important here so important to note theres zero day movement required even if you have  removed of data and very minimal and stuff like great,0.9997,0.184,0.018,0.799
low,lost,company product,account executive we can connect company to it takes about  minutes we could be searching that data within single call right so i think the the speed and the velocity of this while our customer see if they want to see company you like what you see here today data architecture ends account executive like typically its like okay lets we can show more demos that we want to but if you want to see this on your data we can schedule a call and you can connect to it you can see if it if you like it so ill pause there other questions at allclient but thats the i mean im understanding what whats being presented and discussed i think client some key questions that either that youll get to next or tohelp bridge the conversation is can you only search on a data warehouse and lake or like so like i explained like half of our data is in other tools and then its in third party vendor data management  functions client and then how how does the natural language processing actually work if like our schemer or or dimensions are they dont make sense to like anybody but the developer that the the database and then the road im like you can be the best you know sending them producer but if it says like a coded name like no ones gonna yeah you cant solve that data management  functions ends account executive yeah i can systems engineer you can touch on this and then call i think the important but we do have a its once we get connected thats really the next step is we have a slight semantic layer we call it a worksheet so you can grab your table for example maybe has all your coated data fields you can rename them yes you can add synonyms and so you can we call making data search friendly systems engineer sure show you this but the common question thats asked systems engineer do you want to add anything to that yeah i thinksystems engineer its not just the column names that were actually indexing your catalog and all the values and ill show you that the second too so the user doesnt necessarily need to know what the column is they can actually just type in you know customer name or whatever it might be and still be able to search through that generally right somebody does need to actually do that mapping for some names or column names to to change them to make them search friendly agenda client okay that thats thats good clarification because i wouldnt i wouldnt i mean its its until you clarify its like not smoking mirrors and its like how does that actually do it yeahsystems engineeraccount executive awesome so let me show you this real quick theres one other slide i think this is also important too because its kind of like what you just mentioned in your evolution of where youre at data architecture account executive so our agenda i was a client of ours and now third party vendor and have data in third party vendor or were using company but hey i want to use this less than a week and a removed removed and stuff like im actually early adopter of a third party vendor anthem  removed and third party vendor we got connected in nine minutes data architecture ends account executive so again but they did there you want data there we can you know partner with them closely and get you set up so are there any questions or need besides those two you just gonna mentioned before i pass it on to systems engineerclient it it to me and ill make sense and were not in the probably in that threshold and transactions like only our event data is in the removed not unique well theyre rose but theyre separated out by different event tables so were not meghan data levels yet either so thats probably the advantage but also doesnt make it as hard yeahaccount executive  right okay so let me pass it to systems engineer search types account executive i think as you go through this ill ill skim through this as systems engineer showed you this keep these four things in mind people ask what makes us different youll see the user experience like i mentioned were built for non technical users right business or analyst use this as well were always were constantly search indexing and ranking not just the users but the data so the more you use it client the more accurate were getting youll see on systems engineer such a type of query or ask a question because hes logged in and he knows what hes been asking and types of questions so actually just start surfacing them to him and then the query engine because of like anytime you throw in the keywords or english we actually do all the sequel behind the scenes systems engineer and highlight that as well and then our integrator architecture i mentioned this a couple of times zero data movement data architecture account executive we connect any cloud data warehouse so you asked about like a data lake as your well definitely connect directly to ensure do sequel warehouse but we do connect to measure snaps so its like third party vendor big query right starters third party vendor id w data breaks a lot of different as we connect directly to but a lot of the the systems that we do connect with we just inheritsystems engineer  of the same security privilegesaccount executive right roles et cetera it allows us to kind of quickly allow you to start creating your data liveclient yeah so thank you guys for us is like so even if i had money you want them to do this like its not its were were immediately limited by you can only get to the data in our warehouse or in our lakeaccount executive so i think if you were to do this and it kinda going back to what you said the beginning its like hey were on this journey to events so you know have some of these you know data from some of these apps go into a third party vendor for example right are it sounds like a lot of customer data isnt third party vendor i guess some customers have to move data into a cloud data warehouse for them to use company whether it fits one table to table is three tables depending on the use case but theres data in third party vendor at all today data architecture ends account executive whatever it is it can company can search it so we can get thats why im kind of what goes into their i think i believe a lot of your customer data from a conversation with the product team because we also have an embedded analytics tool i think i mentioned that to you in the email i sent back where you can actually embed any piece of company at use but we have our own software developer kit and like developer playground where you can really take like the search bar of our tool and embed it into client application or a portal so i can i can touch on that a little bit but to your point yes there would be need to be data and what are they called it warehouses that we work with deployment options client okayaccount executive cool and ill say this to systems engineer and then ill pass it off to you we do have two different deployment methods we do have a fully cloud base saas managed fully managed saas solution company cloud and then we have our company software which is our onprem version still connect directly to your data source however you then hosted in your nbc so two different options does that make sense deployment options ends client yeah no wed be on the left most likely yeahaccount executive so most people arent too awesome alright let me pass it to you if you want to maybe start withaccount executive yeah started this maybe start with the front end then we can show client i think what goes into actually making the data search friendly thats something that hes curious aboutsystems engineer absolutely so sorry this would be an example of a home screen or user its its all web based first of all and we do have native you know ios and android apps as well so if thats interesting to you basically you have these tiles at the top which can be kpis that that particular user wants to track that are important to them right pinboard systems engineer so they can have these right at the front here you can see down at the bottom here weve got different types of things that basically our answers to questions that people have saved or shared we call these pin boards and and answers and its sort of a crowd sourced approach so the more people use it the more content through is for people to search you can see over here weve got trending pin boards and trending answers these would be the most popular that are being used so if you have somebody whos relatively new or they want to sort of follow somebody whos an author of certain types of content they can quickly do that all from the same screen search types systems engineer whereas have another type of search what you call search data so the first one is searching all of this type of content thats already been done there there the other one is search data so the question that you need to ask is an add hawk questions or its not an a dashboard you know dont dont open a ticket to somebody search types ends systems engineer you could just asking yourself why showcase that just a second here so if i wanted to just to search across things that are already there and maybe im an exact or something i could just say something like you know this is all retail data you know show the info on you know product categorysystems engineer type right and so what its doing is finding everything that has that in there of course were layering on security but anything thats available to them they could actually come in and then click on that and then it gets more influential on that and company will take you directly to wherever that visualization is pinboard systems engineer this is what we call a pin board which is the collection of saved answers and these are all built with search interesting thing about company is users do this themselves through search and then they just say that answer and ill demonstrate that just a second a couple of differentiators for company data drill down systems engineer its dashboards again we call them pin boards as compared to other bi tools is you can drill in any direction at any time without having somebody predefine that hierarchy your drill path right so i can come in here and look at a particular region or whatever and we know that when we get the output back we want to dig in more and ask follow up questions right use cases systems engineer so theres really no no restriction on on getting down to that low screen data so im working with ebay now in with their current tool they can get to two levels deep and thats about it they have eight levels but company they can actually get down to individual transactions individual buyers and sellers so on pinboard systems engineer so thats thats something that we can do thats unique to company the other thing is we have this explorer capability which is basically doing a couple of things is tying in how the individual user uses the data so they dont have to set a bunch of dashboard filters search types systems engineer they can just interact with the data through these through these buttons right and then these will be populated the more and more that that user uses this data right these are all again live i can continue to dig into that data so it makes it a very interactive way to use that for machine learning is basically behind the scenes looking at those usage patterns behind how that user does industry issues systems engineer that that was kind of begs the question what if the answer i need to the question right now is not in the dashboard to i dont want to ask somebody right remember company or those non technical people analyst can certainly use it but definitely built for non technical here data drill down systems engineer i can actually come in and do what we call search data which i mentioned earlier where i can actually come in and ask the questions so maybe i want to see how revenue is doing you know last quarter and compare this to for the last quarter last year change that spelling there and then maybe i want to break this down by,0.9997,0.123,0.03,0.847
low,lost,demo,client its better for me if you actually spell a few your words wrong id actually like to see how that workssystems engineer yeah so couple of things here so lets see here so well do city right if it doesnt find it its just gonna say hey you know i i just cant find it if its something thats off a little bit then itll itll try and corrected for you so it depends on you know the type of things that i i type in here right so we have different algorithms behind the scene that will help depending on the distance of the word as compared to the actual word and so on and how will actually do that so it really depends on on how bad the spelling mistake is so you can see here its actually picking that one up right now whats happening here is company continues you have suggestions as account executive mentioned its gonna get better with time and actually learn so if i come back in if im a brand new user i type something i come back in a minute later it will know that history you know theyll actually be able to suggest those things because those are the most valuable things to me right its also going to continue to suggest things to guide me to miami as quickly as possible no no time here my dragging and dropping things were looking at you know columns and attributes and things like that im just typing in what i need this versus capability is something that no other bi tool has youd have to hard code this right so you can certainly hardcore this one but what if i wanted to compare it to you know you know six weeks ago whatever its completely wide open in the things that you can actually compare pinboard systems engineer a lot of times people use dates but ill show you just second you can use pretty much anything that you werent across all of the data now we always have this you saw the charts are automatically rendering right we also have the tabular view that data and people could download that pinboard ends systems engineer you can actually have an action where you send it to a third party application right you can do all of those types of things those are all built in for you just kinda show you the different chart types we have here were not trying to be a pixel perfect dashboarding tool pinboard systems engineer were trying to get people answers hands where they can make decisions and one or if i wanted to i could come in and change this to a different chart if i need to right now if i liked what i saw maybe ill change this to a bar chart here contract i could actually save this and we call these answers so if you remember from the home screen we had a bunch of answers that pin boards as i save this itll become content thats only visible by me but then what i can do and ill just go and sharethis save this now i can actually share this out with client my colleagues and depending on what privileges i have i could share this out with individuals or a particular groups of people right and then they will get that as part of that body of things that they can search across as well answers are things you would wanna look at periodically right so ive got a list of answers here that i can then you know click on it will rerun that query out to third party vendor pull the data back and give me the latest results right this is an example where were actually doing the comparison across to different counties data drill down systems engineer youre selling your product wanted to look at you know a cohort of people across those counties and see how theyre doing you could quickly do that and lastly i can actually take this and pin it again as a business user to a dashboard right so i can actually create one lets call it client for now industry issues systems engineer and im not having to open a ticket to people that can actually do this right this leaves your team to deals more high profile you know high highly you know highly technical type needs while the users can actually dig into these themselves and again everything here is live and actionable so i can continue to ask questions around that data they keep digging into it over and over again so really less the users get the data in their hands and do whatever they need with it what were finding is people theyll just have that first question theyve got six or seven questions after that so the dashboard is just not not gonna do that let me pause here see if theres any questions and i did want to pivot over to the back end and show you how how it to meclient yeah yeah so im im well aware of the like the business situation where like this type of products and super appealing to executives managers business people but they normally dont understand like the datasets like like all of these examples industry issues ends client like theres always always should have filter out this product or a nurse inactive values like like theres no way you can account for that like again youre doing the same work you

low,lost,demo,systems engineer so as an example so i understand what youre saying as example hp is that a customer of ours for a while their main champion there is vp of sales ops and so on pinboard systems engineer they have a different groups there he he basically it doesnt want to create dashboards anymore and this will lead into my next part of the conversation what they do is they do what account executive mentioned earlier they create those worksheets and do the energy youre talking about once in the worksheet and not have to reproduce that with each dashboard right pinboard ends systems engineer so let me kind of pivot over there so what they do is they dont they dont want to create dashboards and the more that they want to create the worksheet but that energy there and into training right for their users to let them understand how to use the tool and what data is available and then let them just kinda go free either so theres youre not getting peppered with these requests for dashboards anymore so im gonna come to the data tab here actually before i do that on the left here you can you can see this is the worksheet im going to show you in just a second so retail sales this is all the different columns kpis custom fields that the users can search on you can create your own formulas if you want and so on and this is basically how youre balancing or governing that data if i come here to the data tab lets cancel that data management  functions systems engineer oops actually i wanted to score them so you have basically lets find the right one here this is the one so youve got a set of of tables right that are mapped either at at the data warehouse level were in company but basically we we need to understand what tables of course what data is there the columns and so on and then how theyre joints right so thats thats what we need so that way if a user ask about stores and products we know how to actually you know traverse that you can define different different types of joins this is not something a business user would see for sure but this is something that we allow them toin thisday andclientsystems engineer data management  functions ends client this is where the mapping gets donesystems engineeryes so yeah im gonna go into that in a second so yeah once you give us sort of the i call this the physical layer then you start to work on the logical there which is this lightweight semantic model we call a worksheet so heres where you would change those names so this might have been cuss underscore and then he or something right you want to broaden that name and then you want to give one of more synonyms based on how those users want to look at that data right and then the sentiments are things that theyre comfortable with now let me go into this look like i have access to this particular one let me go into a different one yeah this will be very simple similar you have that super set of tables and then you have whatever columns you want to then included in that and then you can have one or more formulas right search types systems engineer and hes just become another search bar right and these can be pretty complex they can you know you can basically use them as building blocks and so on right so you can do lots of different things with these as far as the business users concerned best just another search term industry issues systems engineer most of this is just sample data but thats really about it you know this is where our customers are spending their time is just to to cure rate this is not weeks and weeks worth of work but then once they do that that anybody can ask any question from,0.9919,0.074,0.032,0.895
low,lost,company product, onboarding process client i think the weeks of work depends on how good your engineering team is on labeling thingssystems engineer sure and most of the time what i see is those engineering folks are actually working with the business and sometimes theres even a demarcation where the the data people handed off to the business or somebody whos within the business who knows under who understands how to label those things and what formulas they need all those types of things so yes i totally agree onboarding process ends client wish we could claim that level of maturity but i dont i dont like i think our engineers are semi removed and have their own brain and world and its not like how the business works so we thats why our teams have been successful kind of being the interpreter and translator but its all doable or i dont dispute yeahaccount executive absolutely systems engineer i think one thing we can touch on too and maybe you can provide more detail on as well when we were working with are when we are working third party vendor for example some people say they i mean i would never position company as our data cleansing this tool by any means onboarding process account executive but one of their success criteria is once hey how can i bridge this gap between data or their insights team to their sales team and one of the success criteria like i want to like generate conversations what did you want to see like whats interesting to you what can we create onboarding process ends account executive well can we go find them make available to you right so one of the use cases was building their corporate sales team the ability to leverage their a score right account propensity score and and how can they search in the field and i wanna see companies and finance who have an api score above    for example who use terror data who havent likelihood to buy right who hasnt been contacted in  days you just things like their salespeople just asking quickly define or say what accounts they want to go after but part of that was even third party vendor right they connected to theres no holes in their data shine a light on where were doing that systems engineer you did the same with removed right they did something similar correctsystems engineer yeah so removed came and spoke at our office and they said that was were one of the hidden things hidden benefits that they didnt actually pay for it but they got for free is basically they had been writing queries and using third party vendor in their case and they were using the sequel that was human written or whatever and had lots of issues but then also show as account executive mentioned everybodys got dirty data right but it allows them to focus on where that is and go and fix it i have another customer that sort of says hey ive got a data set thats interesting i guess kinda like what account executive was just saying lets put it into company quickly see if the business users find it interesting and and if they do thats great then we can also iterate on the data cleanliness but itll quickly show you like you said you know its got a big bar with a skew of unknowns are noles or whatever the the fact is there and then you can go in and actually think its fix it to account executive point the c io actually was in a memarketing and hes like maybe are saying the same thing account executive that he actually said wow this is fantastic i can actually see where my data is bad really really quickly by using this tooclient i do agree like i i would argue i dont know if youre saying it or indirectly saying but i would think potentially the bigger value here is not the answers but to identify the questions i think that like you you basically we service we attempt its not the same but like we have a slack channel industry issues client like anybody in the company is allowed to ask any question and then we our team goes and works on it like we literally get a you know multiple a week and suddenly somebody could say something like well what does this or you know how many of that or whats the trend here and then somebody goes and hopefully build a chart and shares it so i could see where this would open up the curiosity because like now they have to go through us and it gets asked in front of  people and theyre probably resistant to actually ask where like if they have free reign they probably ask a lot more questions yeahsystems engineerclient i really like im more entry not from the charting or results but im more intrigued to like the question ability just just to actually get insight to the questionssystems engineer so so if i get out two things so the the vp of removed were working with right now she said a lot of people have these hunches or wanted to sort of dig into or explore the data and theyre theyre basically you know told not to do that because its gonna take too many resources right thatsclientsystems engineer fine they can actually go in and dig into it another thing is we are actually working with a group of removed hes basically got this queue a request and hes just like you know things have to fall off a cliff becausehello himore resources yeahyour listaccount executivesystems engineerclientsystems engineeryeah and then thirdly we do track what people are asking whether or not it was a valid query for that so people can actually go in in mind that and say you know what that team is actually asking about this kind of data and im actually working with another customer thats doing that what questions on my team actually ask them so we we actually record all of that,0.9991,0.146,0.017,0.836

tables because like theres a lot of things people we dont need to do in the beginning with that gives us like a little bit of a frameaccount executive yep okay thats good to know and thats something too i think we can evaluate as we get closer as well pricing account executive its like hey what do we want to connected what are those volumes i think that kinda depends on the the different pricing models as wellclient yeah so like lets just kinda talk that through us like if were in a removed removed of robin data and then i understood the capacity side i thought i did and then their consumption side like what would be the difference there for like that level of dataaccount executive yep so if you go to account executiveing and as i say it a removed removed keep it easy you paid removed right you connected to a removed removed if you go over a removed removed right now you have one point five you need to buy more capacity right lets say its removed removed for your account executiveing reps use it as much as you want all not a removed removed many users many queries as much usage doesnt matter thats thats where youre paying three or  removed he wanted to go the consumption model in that removed removed it doesnt matter how much data you could have removed removed today removed tomorrow itsstill going to be the same price because youre buying credits right youre purchasing a bucket of creditsclient you could try again what was the credit amountaccount executive that are are starting credit package is removed so thats  minutes and its all user initiated actions its not just the title if i checked my fantasy football team or i left and you know lets take an effort to our company its not being used its if your query and clicking around searching you know pricing ends client  and then spend in the back endaccount executive exactly exactly so that allows you to yep yep and that and that doesnt matter data data is unlimited so that way you dont have to like narrow it down to just product you know if you didnt want to have you know jeera or your third party vendor you know data and third party vendor and have you know some use cases there great pricing client  minutes divided by like lets just ballpark  people potentially trying to bang on it thats theyd haveaccount executive yeahclient thats  i dont im not doing the math and frighteningaccount executive yeah though if you had  users and removed we would probably suggest that we get you in a pack with more credits as yeah i have some averages across allclientokay jumping to like if im successful in your to what what iaccount executive gotcha gotcha gotcha all rightclientyeah me and the entry price points we could figure out like a plc and like a small effort like that we scope it smaller with removed or something that im im less worried about that im more like so if this took off like whats it gonna cost me and like year two or three and thats it seems a little scarier than i mean you could argue then youre getting value i know that side of the equation but im trying toaccount executive and what it what it would cost yeah and again theres theres different things that we can put in play i think as like a growth thats something that we can kind of help map out for you too and again the more credits you buy obviously the better the priceclient yeah it seems reasonable so theyre like  people would basically have  minutes which is like two and a half hours theyre definitely the people on the high end at like    hours that theyre probably be a lot of people like you know account executive yeah itll say this right now too and typically its something like we can discuss more details but for some of our customers to right we have power users we have averages that we can go over but we can actually cap the number of credits that they can be consumed that theyre charged four per month right people that im looking at this theyve used  credits this week or this month themselves if they k thats  removed for this one user to use it so like we can put caps on it where they can still use company after but youre not being charged past lets say its  credits a month right it stops being charged so theres those are things that we can kinda idle to kind of help prevent someone using everything pricing ends client alright so lets stay in touch

and coordinate agenda ends client this might be a little different for you but all the requirements that we got from the business team at r n a v kind have sat and the duplicated it so client and i sat together we did they duplicated those and segregated them into two different sets of request the first request is customer demand so this is mostly since our use case is going ahead but only search in the mvp the wanted to focus on search so we have divided so tend to do request and response all the kpis that we want to measure while searching our club under the sheet so you would see these are the relevant yes and what what other measures measures and dimensions which we would want to incorporate are a part of on on these particular kpis and a part of this cheap so for example if you go ahead if if i do just one example search origin i dont see the point of sale country so for this i would want to figure out what are the numbers of search requests that have been triggered for boy to go to point of sale i might also want to narrow it down by how many passengers there there will be a bit i would want to also see that are these requests coming from genesis added more so means are they coming from tries line or a hotel or client so i want to see whats the source for them and then i can go ahead go on so on and so forth in terms of if i want to see on a particular be august i want to have any other additional met the information about this basic kpi for example if i wanted to see what was the trip duration or did the user make advanced searches so all those other kinds of questions that the short answer so for every kpi you have kind of made it a generic list fit anything and everything should be applicable similarly we bifurcated the rest of the kpis and the address funds which is mostly what is the response we got from the system into it you know in the in return for the request that the customer made so this would let us not only know the health of the system but also what kind of data are the serving our customers so for example for the search query that we need on point of sale i want to now see what was the response so i want to see how many requests for success how many requests what failure so those would be different kinds of things that i would want to measure i would i might want to see if there were any sort of views on the request that they want to for example are they do they have express they use that are applicable to them or were these monthly stop names you can obviously filter them all bases on notice i do it by item that goes tony yeah a lot of at the bottom it does for example again you can sort it by company already considered and respect with you know whether it was a one way i didnt knew that we were doing oil oregon trip that we are doing some specifics like which got ears board on and what would the type of these guys are these lucas got yours are worth the school got yours through judy is that done etcetera what was the fair bases back nice so those are some of the examplesthat we have so we have tried to capture and then you can have to see how you are on the our competitors in order to month on month comparison what you would see different here is also that there are some some rules that we i have like the added last week i guess on friday after i sent out the sheet to you guys because those were some of the things that were missing so i just i just highlighting them here that these are the additional fields that being added industry issues account executive excellent so it looks like theres quite a bit of quite a bit of granularity theres quite a few you know if you start at the top there with the questions and the the kpis theres quite a few different variations that then result from a specific search is that a fair statement yes andclientaccount executive so thats why im just making sure so so part of why we do this is we wanna make sure that you know if its if you have a dashboard tool and you can achieve what were trying to do with the dashboard theres no point in going through this with us right so we we wanna make sure that were were kind of aligning both the data model as well as the value proposition of what we provide so if we look at this the the challenge that youre having today and and correct me if im wrong is your kpis that you have dont allow you to then drill down and and ask kind of those those next three four or five level questions is that fair industry issues ends client yes so right now in my understanding and all client and client would be the right people to correct me if im wrong you is that we can we can drill down but there has to be something that would help us do this so the end user per se they dont go and modify the dashboards that we have currently modern done industry issues client third party vendor its clients team who goes entities new dashboards with every request so whatever the request from the end users we go and we have to create those dashboards and sometimes dynamics visiting then becomes a problem because not all send those are not on fields would be all present an applicable one on our third party vendor dashboard that would be you know that the user can go in and just play around industry issues ends client may i ask just so i understand a little bit better i have to i im not too familiar with your company so so one of the it sounds like one of the advantages is that that youre able to to create something in which the end user has the flexibility to kind of adjust how they want to view the data whereas currently we use third party vendor on our day to day where its a lot more rigid you know we got filters and whatever we set up but like thats you know any changes that end user once and i suppose from myself and my team so i it sounds like with company the advantages youre able to set it up in a way in which the end user can kinda just select almost like a pivot tables click and drag in a sense something like that im sure that simplified like a lot but,0.9993,0.144,0.025,0.831
low,lost,about company,account executive that is a that is a very simplified way to say what we do absolutely but yeah actually i might i might steal that from you because thats a good way to say it the it is essentially like a pivot table but in in such a way that an end user who doesnt understand your data model and doesnt understand kind of the the necessity of what theyre trying to achieve is able to get to the right information very very quickly data drill down account executive so as a as an example if they wanted to search for a nonstops price and last  days right thats thats literally them writing the words nonstop last  days and then the results that would pop up and then from there they could right click and drill down on any of these measures and dimensions and they can make adjustments on the fly so if they wanted to change from name to or some from nonstop two or three stops or from price to cost they could do that right industry issues account executive so its a very simple process for them to make those adjustments versus coming back to you and asking for those adjustments to be made so its its really a paradigm shift right so youre focused on the data model as opposed to focus on making adjustments to the dashboard wrapup client yep thank you thank you very much right explanation account executive absolutely it actually would be good for us to perhaps take  minutes maybe not in todays call but take  minutes and walk you through the product just so you can kind of take that and and look at this industry issues account executive because one thing id be interested in understanding is its kind of you know from your perspective today when a user ask those questions you know how many how many requests are you receiving and how many times are you having to go through and and make those adjustments how many dashboards are resulting from that data management  functions account executive you know what what are those levels of details because perhaps theres some other measures and dimensions you want to add into this or the questions that are more relevant that you want to look at is kind of that first level because it doesnt require that will make dashboards right data management  functions ends account executive it it requires that we kind of think through some aspects of this but at the same time adding and element to the search results and the the model is very very simple so we dont have to make the perfect data model right out of the box okay thats awesome yeahclientaccount executiveclient yeah i mean i would love to see your product in that sense especially the like you said how can we visualize kind of like what what is capable of as wellaccount executive absolutely absolutely how many how many users are you servicing today for this informationclient and the name business seems probably about  people as far as the name directors go client so okayclientclient but id say at least that many and then if you added people on like the kinds of systems integrity side like the lisa now she is of the world id say its probably somewhere around clientyeah probably  i would say by the sounds of itclientand then the and then understanding client his team andyeah team and and leadershiphelloclientclientclientyeah and i guess we are also looking at get giving all the product managers like part of the product team access as this so you can add another  to  folks actually use who would then be looking at all this information pricing client so right under  but somewhere in the range of like  plusaccount executive okay yeah and and thats really where we kind of come in right is is backlog and reduction and scalability so if you have  people in each one requestto minor changes to dashboard and each minor change takes two hours you know all of a sudden youve got to fulltime resources just dedicated to making minor changes to dashboards so pricing ends company employee curious about that right client how does this or you know for anybody really im sorry youre just hop on my youre the first person i can see go on top down client client sorry client somehow you got pushed back a little account executive if im looking at these that these measures and dimensions how does like a request from a user come from you im im kind of i have a vision of my head how it comes but how does what do you get like what what happens in your dayclient  sorry im not sure if i understand like whatcompany employee yeah yeah they just product one of these product owners or partners and they come to you with the question say hey client hey heres the heres what it is i need to know number motto spots stops yesterday in city is it stuff like thatclient oftentimes with search data thats why its kind of divided into two portions if it depends on the individual whos coming so first one is i know that customer demand aspect so theres the two separate api so we have a one api is purely the request side and its kind of like what the cause customer kind of come in and search essentially and whats beneficial i think client and team would benefit and feel free to correct me client but i believe like thats where youll get a lot of benefit trying to understand what the customer demand is where theyre searching what kinds of passengers are being search things of that nature just really understanding our customer itself yeahcompany employee like an email or they call you up or how they do the slack when they asked for the stuff can be any of the aboveclientcompany employee yeah yeah are they supposed to do it a certain way like follow into some kind of have a request it can be any of the above and and you get a lot of requests perdayclient i wouldnt say per day no search searches a little bit more new to to us as well especially what we have in front of us with the the details of what weclient yeah so that so i would say it also to the price some questions that arent ask because theyre not really sure how to get the answer so theres that piece of it yeah so as he just from the name director side we might have a situation where you know we look at one carrier and you know we sell you know say  carriers or something that and one in particular is gonna be a top  carrier was down like  percent last week and youre like thats weird and is it that they werent coming back and search as much as they were the week before is it that they fly to a place that there was a hurricane last week you know theres a bunch of different questions you try to answer it and and ways that you try to figure out those answers so from like a system health perspective it could be that you know maybe the searches were coming back from are capturing them correctly or something or it could be that someone on the systems side of the business whos looking at these things also seems like failure rates increases and theyre trying to figure out like okay like what whats causing that,0.9994,0.14,0.023,0.838
low,lost,customer base,client so theres a bunch of different ways that you can look at it and say from the name business side were also looking at it from like a a carrier perspective like why is there a performed better than carrier be and in terms of the the risk you know searches to do buyers care of you just not coming back a lot or or their ferris four removed higher than everyone else is fairs that we get back to use cases ends client all of their names have a one stop wherever analysis nonstop is it the case that theyre fair includes the check bags for more expensive than someone who doesnt include the check right all those types of things and things wed want to try to answer as if like business team but theres also two id say of the teams that like kind of like start asking client questions theres like that kind of day to day mowing the lawn is for the five directors making sure things are working and surfacing the accounts and then also to yet from the leadership side they just might get like that one like you know arrow the front door of like hey i want to know like this because they have to you know to tell somebody for a memarketing or something so those requests will probably urgent and often email and and often come maybe last minute but its you know can can client team kind of struggled to find an answer and then theres the the kind of more than oraccount executiveclient less urgent but highly frequent like okay how about you know what what has changed last since last week or what is going on with this care or is this namenm not performing well in these ap bands things like thatcompany employee so i think its just fascinating i think well i know that i probably wouldnt know how to ask the right questions of this data but id be fascinated to say like the example you said top  carriers one of them is down  percent trying to figure out why you figure out why lets say you can figure it out like in five minutes so what it does i dont understand like its fascinating information but what what what is what then happensclient yeah i mean its helpful to them to at least know like okay its not because youre checking to see like if you know if something is broken that we need to fix then theyre like okay lets go fix it like they had a connection to a gs that we use to to book the reservations that was down last week okay that explains it or you know they might come to us and say hey you know we noticed our clients are down do you see whats going on well be all set yeah weve looked at the search data and nobodys searching your names to hawaii because there was a title like they would probably know a bunch of that but they would be able to see like okay is it that all the searches last week were off for everybody or is it just down for us you know so theres a bunch of different questions that we might get okaycompany employeeclient yeah so if if if if it point of view a system problem then we try and resolve the system problem if its pointing to a carrier like verifying issue or something or like your first our competitive anymore this is why youre down we would say okay youre you know im just getting you know  removed refreshing circus runs and i am from you know our tell you so thats why everyones client over here instead socompany employee you know where theyre client you can tell how theyre where theyre client somewhere else,0.9987,0.19,0.033,0.777

low,won,company product,customer success architect  and then you have the option of sending a welcome email you can do its totally optional if you want i skipped over this sharing visibility here because i i think this is an important concept to call out specifically theres two options here shareable and not terrible when you go into company and you actually create an answer or a pin board or a piece of content  pinboard ends  customer success architect  you have the option of sharing that out with other users and what we what what users presented in this dropdown is controlled specifically by this sharing visibility option so if the user or the group is shareable you would select to shareable otherwise its not terrible i would client  say customer success architect  general keep all users as shareable so that other users can share directly to users but certainly you have the option of coming in here if you dont want someone to to share directly to this finance user you come in and turn it off its not shareable you might do the same thing with the built in administrator account account and put that as non shareable so did you have any questions i guess high level on the fields that are required here client  wow what kind of things can be customer success architect  correct so sorry youre youre a little bit far away from them client  alright itscustomer success architect  really who what users and groups are displayed here in this sharing property  pinboard  customer success architect  so if you were to create a new answer you come in here just create a dummy answer and then the share menu client  i see so you into your answer right got it got it okay customer success architect  its really who who is set up to be shared two and thats really all that that is that is  pinboard ends  client  got it engagement manager  yeah i feel like the keyword on that one is visibility because its not a permission of sorts client  okay customer success architect  and then optionally when you create a new user you can you can assign them to various groups and you can assign them to multiple groups at once or or none at all as well when a user comes in and well talk more about security here like the general tiers and security here in a sec but when a user comes in if you dont define any groups with them and you havent shared any piece of content to all users theyll actually see nothing  pinboard  customer success architect  you can actually come in here create a local user thats a dummy user log in as that user and they wont be able to see any piece of content no so no answer is no pin boards no data sourcescustomer success architect  so thats just about it on users its not a super complicated screen  pinboard ends  customer success architect  well go over to groups next and youll see again all the different groups that we have here on the platform it looks like weve already created a couple of here power user company user groups if you wanted to create a group again same thing you could do through the ui you can come in here specify the group name the group name is going to be internal wheres the display name is what is shown sort of in that that sharing visibility screen here as well and actually let me client  he customer success architect  put this to shareable for just a sec so we can display so i also have to reload so if i wanted to share to all the company users i could type in company up here and youll see company now way shareable group again sharing visibility users or groups doesnt really matter here client  and the group will be alerted yeah email windows share is yeah okay customer success architect  yeah if if i had send notification checked and then i shared it certainly yeah they would be notified notified notified notified wow but if you dont if you dont have that checked and you share it they wont actually be note directly notified client  you dont disappear for example the answer will just show up when they log in an  pinboard  customer success architect  right they would have access to that specific piece of content being an answer or pin board or or whatever okay okay in the group case you can add like a free form description field super useful if you have multiple types of different multiple types of groups that are similar just helps you sort of disarm them from their group name pinboard ends  customer success architect  and then we have a list of privileges here as well that we can sign assigned to specific groups by default company will sort of add these two privileges upload and download data for all users and youre in in a given new group you can certainly come in here and just uncheck all the different privileges and and start from a blank slate  pinboard  customer success architect  if you collect click this i but you can actually go to our documentation page that has all the different types of privileges and sort of have a little bit of a description here but were actually gonna go through and talk about the different privileges right now  pinboard ends  customer success architect  so the top one here pretty self explanatory its kind have a all encompassing privilege and in my opinion and sort of are not necessarily best practice but that they administer candidate management company will include everything underneath it so you wouldnt necessarily need to come in and check everything you can just check the top button and have sort of about local administrator privilege for this specific group the next to like i said allow users to upload or extra data from the platform in the upload user or user data case i dont know this is actually enabled and cloud  deployment options  customer success architect  so its its sorta have maintained for version compatibility in in backwards version compatibility and it might be actually be something we can enable specifically on cloud but i dont think this this is actually enable for your end users even if you had this selected for them so just sort of rule of thumb dont i wouldnt enable this for for your user groups  deployment options ends  customer success architect  specifically this next privilege has developer privilege allows the end user or the the users in this particular group to be able to see this developed tab develop is a feature let me go like this that allows you to do embedding it alive you to actually play with the the playground the specific developed playground within the app idont know no that thats necessarily relevant to to client its sort of more of an advanced workflow but if you wanted to embed company in your own application or in your own website you certainly could do that and theres a privilege at controls access to that developer tab can share with all users bypasses this shareable setting if the group has this setting or this privilege on it then they will actually be able to see all of the groups within company and all of the users within company regardless of if they have shareable or not shareable set on that particular user group  data management  functions  customer success architect  cant manage data is a privileged that allows you to go in and create worksheets and modify worksheets it also allows you to come in and create embrace connections so you can come in here from data connections and create new embrace connections one note on that is it only allows users who created the connection to see their own connections,0.9999,0.228,0.02,0.753
low,won,onboarding,customer success architect  so if you have multiple i dont know that this is super relevant with with client because i think your developer persona is kind have more of an administrator persona but if you had multiple developers per use case so maybe you have a a finance use case and you have a and ill sort of an inventory management use case the folks that are responsible for understanding what what properties are in in your business and and sort of doing the management side of that you might have multiple developers building worksheets on that sort of data  onboarding process ends  customer success architect  i think its its not necessarily like super relevant for help make your your companys a little bit smaller a little bit more tightknit but cant manage data will allow you to go create new worksheets edit worksheets but also create and edit the embrace connections themselves,0.9801,0.198,0.037,0.765
low,won,company product,customer success architect  the next couple of features here can use experimental features and can invoke customer analysis and actually even can or has name privilege pinboard ends  customer success architect  these are all sort of advanced features within the platform experimental features there if theres not really great guidance on on what this actually enables within the platform but think of it like especially in cloud well have a limited availability release of certain features and this is kind of what sort of of gates access to those features within the platform in my experience both of these two features are sort of leave off always custom our analysis is an older feature that we have that will be eventually replaced by something thats much better functionality and its kind have enabled for backwards compatibility again in in in practice i dont ever enable both of these and i dont recommend that customers enable both of these unless they have specific use cases where are is is required or specific use cases where they want to sort of release new functionality out to their user base  search types  customer success architect  and then name is a in advance im part of the platform in general and i dont typically release that to end users until theyve had maybe four two six months of experience with company so its one of those things that its just a power user activity or a even power user elite activity because it is easy to get name wrong  name  customer success architect  its a very powerful feature that helps you do anomaly detection and helps you find sort of ask a  questions on your data or help you sort of narrow your scope on on the interesting data but again its its more advanced and sort of easy to get wrong  data architecture  customer success architect  so i hesitate to to enable this to a large breadth of users until theyve had a lot of experience with company itself just using the platform account executive yeah the the only thing ill add to that as well is on the current like query base licensing model will want to stay away from name just so we dont need up all of the consumption customer success architect  right thats a good point considering we are using third party vendor name or yes but i came in general well issue many queries to to do what it needs to do and asaccount executive was saying that could be cost prohibitive and it could be something we would want to obviously understand what were doing before we actually use it  pinboard  customer success architect  and certainly if you if you give that ability to a whole bunch of users and they start generating maybe hundreds of queries that could be bad customer success architect  the next one that i want to talk about is this can schedule pin boards again sort of a power user activity it could be useful for your more executive sort of on on the flip side it could be more useful for your executive team if you have a pin board here you can come in and actually schedule when that would get sent out so you see this manage schedules here thats what is enabled with that that specific privilege so it allows you to your end users to to get pushed the data from company in terms of either an excel document or a pdf document on a regular basis and then this last one here engagement manager  right sorry i was gonna say the scheduling the pin boards if theres something thats being looked at consistently if you schedule it and its being sent out as a pdf  pinboard ends  engagement manager  it can allow you to be a little bit more frugal with your credit consumption by just sending the data out so it runs the query wants to send the emails rather than  users running in and re query customer success architect  yeah thats a good point because if your your users dont necessarily need to come in and search name is absolutely correct were going to generate that pdf once on the company side and then reuse that or send that out to the the list of users that are on that schedule very good point this last one is can administer and bypass role level security im not sure if we necessarily have a need for real level security in in your use case but we we can certainly talk about it and how you would set that up there is a privilege though that allows obviously you to bypass that so we we essentially just ignore those rules that we set up on the various tablescustomer success architect  also here you can select a list of or a certain amount of default pin boards for this specific group and sort of nest various groups as well as assigned some users as youre creating new groups name has told me in the past i havent had a huge need to automatically assign users to groups but you certainly could come in here assign a new group and then send out a sort of have a welcome email with the creation of that group i know engagement manager said that that was something that shes used quite a bit of a removed  pinboard  customer success architect  in in her past its not something that i necessarily done myself though engagement manager  the default pin boards its also a good one so as you mentioned and i think earlier just having something to land on when youre a new user is is also great  pinboard ends  engagement manager  and so that was something that other company we created a dummy database that was available to everyone today that was associated with all of our training documents customer success architect  i know i just talked for about  minutes about ui elements that can get kinda boring do you have any questions on i guess the the privileges that are available before we actually get into how we think about structuring our groups and what our best practices are there,0.9996,0.194,0.038,0.768
low,won,onboarding,client  hey just yet lets see here so quick commentary on the i dont know if name saw today but im just on the items that we were we were thinking of right were gonna hold the release until we figure out what was happening with some of those issues that we pointed out,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0
low,won,small talk,client  and i dont know if weve had any update on those if i missed it in the first few minutes of todays meetingcustomer success architect  doesnt look like name is on yet name did you said he was he was gonna be a little bit late engagement manager  i was just gonna check in slacks i cant recall if he said he was going to be late or unable to it and,0.4813,0.086,0.058,0.856
low,won,onboarding, onboarding process  account executive  yeah ulysses i think if we can do is as followup name let me ping him right now to see if he can jump on provide that and if not ill get a write up on the kind of the outstanding  onboarding process ends  customer success architect  okay do list is where we good to move client  sure alright customer success architect  so now that weve covered some of the ui elements it it helps to understand the different levels of security or different layers of security that we we have an company at the very front weve got just pure authorization how do you get into the platform and thats user with your user name and password we do offer l dap and and single sign on client  but customer success architect  thats kind of your your gate into company what we just talked about was the various permission groups or permission levels within company pinboard  customer success architect  so what what what privileges can we assigned to a particular group so what they can do within the platform so im so sorry so that we can control what they do within the platform from there youll see this yellow section with pin boards answer search worksheets and views and these are kind of what the different objects that users can access within the platform,0.9801,0.144,0.01,0.846
low,won,company product,customer success architect  so if they get past the authorization and then theyve also got access to do hello particular things in the platform if we havent actually shared any content with them they can go in but they cant actually see any content so the next level here is actually that sharing ability to to very various groups and various users and what we try to do is we share particular pieces of content to groups that way we dont have to manage at a user level what the user can particularly see users can still share within their own groups and when well talk about that here in just a minute but thats kind of our our next level of of security if a user hasnt been shared a piece of content they can actually see it and then finally you have the row level security or the data masking or even more advanced column level security this is again sort of i dont know this is super necessary and health picks case but we we could certainly go over that and how we might think of of data access im gonna leave that towards more of the end as we talk about the different types of user groups because it does get a little bit more complicated and does get more difficult to understand as we think about best practices  pinboard  client  just a quick question i see views i dont think ive used it before ive done a lot of workshops but not split the difference between the two of them customer success architect  so you can actually come in here and save lets just go through an answer you can actually come he doesnt yeah create a view from a particular answer and its its pretty much the exact same thing as you would do in third party vendor   data architecture  customer success architect  the only drawback of doing get an company would be youre asking company to do that that calculation is kind of the the as we go back to formulas right so company formulas are run time calculation and so would the view the views also sort of have this run time object data management  functions  customer success architect  so as your users or query on top of that view company got to generate the query the sequel necessary to create that view and use some of it cpu to be able to do that  data architecture  customer success architect  if you can offload that and do that view in third party vendor  theres going to be better for your overall health of the platform just because youre not using some of the cpu to do that activity client  really recommended to create them you company its more on name third party vendor s side thats more ive read it okay  pinboard  customer success architect  right especially if you have that ability already so some of your users might not have that ability in third party vendor itself so theyll want to prototype something out and and answer get to that view created theyll need that can manage data privilege to do so but if they wanted to they certainly could come in here create that view and then use that in an answer or use that in worksheet development so to speak  data architecture  client  it does not create an actual third party vendor side right its just a layer on in company customer success architect  right its only going to be here in company okay again no functional difference from doing it in third party vendor  but there is that that resource consideration that you would want to take into account as well  data management  functions  customer success architect  and if you can keep all your views and your database objects together i would typically recommend that anyway regardless of your platform its just about what what is the the development workflow on the name side okay client customer success architect  okay so lets do lets go back to here so we talked about the different levels right  data management  functions ends  customer success architect  you have authentication youve got privileges youve got the actual content then youve got data data itself that you can you can get access to so what this slide is talking about is how we actually view the different types of groups and company so the very left youll have groups that are focused on only defining the privilege step thats that users can do within company so whether theyre end users power users data managers developer so on they are specifically going to be not shareable too so you would define again what they can do within the platform versus what they can see and then you would not share those out so that and use wouldnt be able to share to all of the developers on the company or all of the different power users in the company on the flip side you have content access groups so these have no privileges assigned with them but they would have a business friendly names or or usually sort of like a one two one with the use cases that youre building company so youll have one for your sales team or your marketing team and so on and so forth these groups would would certainly have sharing on so that they do show up in that sharing list but they wouldnt have any actual privileges associated with them so does that core understanding sort of match or do you understand why we would we would have one set of groups focused on privileges versus one set on specifically on content customer success architect  i dont know you just went on mute you might client  sorry can you repeat that customer success architect  does it make sense why you would have one set of groups specifically devoted to privileges versus one set up groups specifically devoted to content so when a user can do in the platform or privileges versus what a user can see in the platform in in content client  pretty much his name would you say its only for admin versus benclient  so so so thats the same as what we have in in in state right so one is you know what data do you have access to it and then what can you actually do in the system right so how and i think you would still have it for users because there are certain core i guess functionality that you can enable on the user side in addition to secure the data client  yeah customer success architect  yeah so let me maybe it maybe it makes sense to just go through sort of an example right so i know in here weve already got a power user group and maybe we would not give them a share with all users and not upload data but maybe maybe their advanced users they dont really understand how to use company so they can they can manage data  pinboard  customer success architect  they can create worksheets they can download data because they want to be over to explore that data in excel or something like that theyve also got can schedule pin boards and has name privileges so maybe theyre sort of gatekeepers to who can get scheduled pin boards and so weve weve got a power user and this would be not shareable because this is governing what they can do within the platform  pinboard ends  customer success architect  and im not actually gonna gonna save this but this will be a number of users across your business regardless of if theyre sort of in marketing or finance or or the different business groups and then you would have a group in here specifically for maybe like sales thats backwards sales sales and this group would be shareable but it would have no privileges whatsoever so when you go into the sharing menu only this the sales display name here would show up and all the users that are associated with that group  pinboard  customer success architect  but now the power user group because we dont want to share were power users we want to share particular pieces of content with the sales users does the the sort of the separation of concerns make more sense now is customer success architect client  the purpose of this purpose ill need to share content so because youre not really doing what can this user do so when create sales and then set it to shareable and they see answers and being search on their own customer success architect  yeah so exactly thats a good question so thats exactly what we would do so we would come in here to maybe a worksheet and we would share that directly to sorry  pinboard ends  customer success architect  we would share that directly to a specific group right now everyone can see it thats not necessarily what we would do normally so if we had that sales group maybe thats a company group we would share directly to company or sarah share it directly to sales so again this this would be shareable and no privileges associated with it so were just using this group for sharing and and for content access because if we go back to sort of the levels here we have an company we want to be able to separate this layer from what they can actually do in the platform right so thats why we we have a group thats associated with with what they can do versus a group associated with what they can see client  in in content is people are searching even worksheet and views alright competence to be sharing okay customer success architect  correct client  okay got it and im guessing peoples are not part of calm and so we thats not shareable table  data management  functions  customer success architect  you technically can share them to various groups its just not recommended you so if you think about when when you create a piece of content on top of atable if you were to go and change that table or alter that table you would need to drop the the content thats on top of it or involve one of the change management scenarios that we can talk about later again we would need to essentially employee one of those scenarios rather than being able too freely change that table whenever we want so typically we only ever share worksheets directly with users or directly with groups we wouldnt necessarily share the tape underlying tables with our user community  data management  functions ends  client  okay so you listed in that sense any thinking delay or if the users then they only have going to have access to answers in board searching worksheet right client  yeah for most most users yeah thatll be the extent client  somewhat like the data mart concept where youre segregating the different type of work keeps me client  yeah yeah so so it really for us its back to the whole data and relevant level security we wont have but its most likely going to be based on the on the worksheets that would equate to our data march are important too client  okay client  i may have more right and others im limited so maybe its by function i have to figure it out,0.9999,0.182,0.033,0.785
low,won,pricing,customer success architect  and if you think about it as sort of a hierarchy so youll have a number of annual like  percent of your your user some company would be end users maybe another  or so would be power users and then the rest would be either developers right,0.7759,0.147,0.0,0.853
low,won,company product,customer success architect  administrators so maybe like one percent be administrators from the rest would be developers or or these these users that are able to control what gets built in company and then youll have just a functional group or not a functional group sort of a display group for your different business units or different use cases and you would share that to the worksheets or the default pin boards over to those types of groups also a user can have multiple groups so youll have an end user for sales and an end user for marketing and an end user for finance and then so on and so forth right client  yeah okay customer success architect  and certainly an end user refer sales as well as finance i mean again the user can have multiple groups so theres no you can sort of get control i mean get access to various parts of your platform through the use of the various content access groups on the privilege access groups customer success architect  okay so the final one here is his role level security i just want to show you how you might set up role level security again we would have this sort of third type of group so that way were separating the idea of what they can do versus what they can see versus what they can see within a particular table the let me just show typically we would not these are shareable and then if we needed to to implement some sort of hierarchy and the lowest level of the group is actually the sort of inherits so if you have the lower portion of the inheritance chain actually goes up so if you have a public data everyone in public data can see pii data im sorry everyone and secure data could cpi and confidential versus public data wouldnt be able to see anything here in this chain so going over to lets just pick a particular view youll see or particular table we defined role level security on the table itself so you can come in here too security and then add a particular role if we expand the rule assistant here youll see there are two special i mean its essentially a formula that we we define on a table and theres two special we call them variables but to special fields that you can use that identify the currently logged in user user name specifically and then also what groups that that user has been associated with and then its just about coming in here and defining my role so you can say company groups equals and ill maybe finance and this can get arbitrarily complex weve got a number of different formulas in here you can use or logic in here as well and then if we went and save this name finance rls group and we wanted to implement another rule we could do that all rules are applied in and fashion so if you had a finance group and a marketing group probably a bad name but you could certainly come in here and define both rules and then both rules are evaluated for every single row of data essentially what this is doing is creating aware clause thats not optional and so that wear claws gets added to any query using this table and well get executed on the the various users that are low the user thats logged inclient  security level essentially blocking access to the whole people customer success architect  would qualify individual rows so if the if this expression evaluates to true dummy rule that does nothing so this would always be true for every single row right but if you had ts user name is equal to make dot cooper i dont remember what my user name specifically is  data management  functions  customer success architect  but if i save this on this particular table and you were not an admin you would see no records unless you or me client  ive seen say other users are block from viewing the stable or even searching for these people so even if theres a worksheet that realize that its stable they wouldnt be looked into this or  data management  functions ends  customer success architect  thats correct yep okay theyd still be able to search but no data would come back because client  yes okay customer success architect  yeah this value get substituted for your user name and so in the wear claws if thats false then that obviously that role wrote a data doesnt come back any of rows of data would not come back customer success architect  righty thats about it in terms of security i know i spent probably about  minutes talking did you have any questions sort of on no we the different types of groups or why we would i guess set up the different types so content versus privilege i really wanna make sure that that that idea is clear before i say were were sort of good to move on from securityclient  yeah i think that makes sense client  can you also show the column level because ive seen dobro yeah customer success architect  level security is actually a back end flag to enable particularly because it is hard to get right so if we actually needed column level security its something that i would highly recommend we set up an office hour session on or even plan to do during this engagement  data management  functions  customer success architect  because its its just its not necessarily performance and theres other ways that we could handle that without having to implement column level security right client  okay okay client  and is that the same thing with data masking customer success architect  good question data masking wed actually be handled with a formula so we dont have data masking in the sense of we could set up a rule on the table like in like we do and row security but you could certainly go into a worksheet and and do data masking based on the different formulas that we have enabled  data management  functions ends  client  i see okay and thats different from the formatting you showed me before customer success architect  youre gonna have to jog my memory what did i showed you before specific client  i dont worry about it its its probably different those date formatting or numbers not be disconnectedcustomer success architect  right yeah okay i see what youre saying yeah it wouldnt be its not the format patter here or anything like that,0.9995,0.179,0.029,0.792
low,won,next steps,customer success architect  okay i think what ill do is ill also send you these number slides theyre kind of just from my demonstration purposes but i think they convey the idea well the different types of different different types of security and company as well as how we might structure our groups  agenda ends  customer success architect  and then we talked about all this and its visually displayed on slide number but its good to have just a one pager there to understand the different types of groups but that is all i had today from a security standpoint okay engagement manager  i think the sort of the homework here is really to configure your users and your groups would be a good start  next steps  engagement manager  and i think we also want to looking forward to thursdays session so i think thursday i mean weve got that the hour and a half session id like to i think review sort of where were at with the formula is what the performance is looking like and i believe client you connected with name at the end of last week,0.992,0.237,0.018,0.745
low,won,onboarding,engagement manager  so i would say for the performance so take a look at the tickets i believe theyre all created to name get able to join no so i believe theyre all created and you can track the status there and also request or add updates to it and youll and youll hear back so there are sort of managed by another team so our support really our systems reliability engineers are the ones who will address the tickets so its actually most efficient to go through them for the updates but obviously if youre not getting feedback and what feels like a reasonable time on those feel free to escalate through myself or name other than that i think what we want to sort of move through and see where were at on thursday with the worksheets and with the performance if anything else has come back and we should start looking at serve end user training and scheduling that and whats going to happen i did also have a question just on user acceptance testing and if thats gone anywhere on your end client  no i mean right now were stop right that we cannot roll this out to users based on the performance issues and just the instability the application last week when we demo all the issues i was going to schedule that for next tuesday but theres no way we can let them loose on it so i think were gonna were gonna be were definitely slipping were going to get behind account executive  yeah customer success architect engagement manager how do we how do we approach the performance issue peace customer success architect  hi i was looking into that this past weekend and a little bit is friday or thursday unfortunately i dont think we have sort of any different approaches for handling the the the semi additive data and sort of how we would go about that,0.986,0.138,0.045,0.816
low,won,next steps,customer success architect  i dont i cant think of any other creative solutions and i pulled a couple of architects on on our side that you sent me additive or have worked with semi added additive data quite a bit and they werent able to come up with anything interesting either account executive  about the yeah like bumping up the third party vendor instance like is that is that something that would help customer success architect  yeah more than likely it will help i think were at either a small or medium right now and so if we bump up to the next level that will obviously help with query latency thats kind have are are i wanted to be my last resort because i i have a hard time saying hey we have to spin up more resources to handle this but i think thats kind of where were at where where its left us  data architecture  account executive  so you name is is that something that is like possible to explore client  i mean we we we can explore to see if it gives us more performance but i have a hard time to say that i need to large warehouse to get company to work efficiently i mean i kenny imagine the the cost associated with that if we have engagement manager i thought one of the one of the data sources when i was on a small when we talked last week client  it was on a spot its been running on small account executive  yeah you you listed in in granted i dont know what all goes into this but like can we get can we like test it with the third party vendor team to like almost like pull them in and say hey like lets get you know get on a medium or get on a large and see if that helps which you know we could do hope maybe even as like a trial or something like im im happy to reach out to that team to to investigate if if youre okay with me doing that yeah data architecture ends  client  i mean if its gonna help us and weve done that with other like third party vendor  is third party vendor and issues that weve weve had when we first rolled out that connection so we have a consultant kind of work with them on our behalf to i had problems yeah no shit here i mean we can figure out what we need to you and if we want to do it on a trial basis and kick up the yeah the warehouse account executive  awesome okay and so i know name is it was third party vendor anymore do you know who your new rep is are there would be your point of contact is stuff like client  i can find out i know yeah weve been assigned a new account executive  yeah its certainly if you did that to me ill reach out to them kinda give them the story and see if we can get them to get us the the larger instance to try it out client  well if its just flipping the the database we we can definitely do that other i guess i dont know what they would you know i was hoping maybe with them itll be something in the connection or something that they wouldnt be able to resolve those issues and how thats coming over customer success architect  mean i think theres even an opportunity account executive for for me and the se on the third party vendor side to just run a couple of queries and poke at third party vendor  can see you know just so that theyre thinking in terms of what company is doing and not just looking at a query general  data architecture  customer success architect  yeah great on that with a couple of different clients unless hes and sometimes we find something really interesting that we can do and and sometimes its its less interesting data architecture ends  account executive  yeah great call im im almost wondering if you know let lets figure out who the rep is all customer success architect ill set up like an internal call that like us in the third party vendor team can kinda get on and walkthrough and then you know depending on the outcome of that we can either you know fix the issue then or we can talk about getting the larger size account executive  cool so yeah client  if you can if you can send that over to me ill ill ill take that one as an action item client  yes i found a name yeah ill send it to you account executive  perfect okay cool account executive  so engagement manager i so i think the main homework here for clientclient side is really just getting users and groups setup,0.9996,0.249,0.037,0.713

low,won,customer base,account executive  okay gotcha and thats youre not alone majority of the customers we work with and thats kind of where the the data worlds changing right is theres a lot of data out there and theres very few people that are really expensive and very helpful that know how to manipulate it and work with it and then you have that are sitting here saying clienta lot more a lot more right its like its like when you give a baby candy right its almost like crack you know that you give it to them and theyre like this is awesome and then theyre coming back though i want more of what more can you show me this id like to see it instead of a pie chart i want to see it in a sack data charter same thing thats thats what we found out thats where company really came in is our our bi journey really starts with the dashboard ends right because when you present someone a dashboard you know lets just say a salesperson or head of sales marketing whatever it may be you know you hit you hit the nail on the head right they come back and they say awesome useful based off of this now i want to know this  industry issues  account executive  so are you are experiencing a good amount of backlog or just not being able to keep up with everything that i wanted to ask you is just getting too much client backlog you know its a backlog of like reports that needed to be done and its a backlog of also have when you call this follow upaccount executive  okay yeah with reports and follow up client okay account executive  and what does that backlog looks like obviously you probably fluctuate but are we talking a backlog of a day or two a couple of weeks client man account executive  years client i would say i would say weeks yeah well a lot of it you know say i wonder if i thought of this you know i wonder if you look at it this and go like you know theres always like a lot of like add hawk requests and all of that you know i i do wish that you know this add hawk requests can be had did today and like finding yourself type of things like self serving you know account executive  so thats what we do do and we do a damn good job at it yeah just to kind of understand that the backlog a little more or kinda go below the surface level there with these with these backlog issues with people waiting a couple of weeks right or maybe even a couple of days and i would assume lives people asking for this data is because they need the data to make a decision right for whatever xyz reason it is what is what does that look like,0.9951,0.142,0.007,0.851
low,won,customer base, use cases  account executive  and the and the estate planning or or marketing right marketing you know who do we market to how do we market what what is kind of a cost of one of those decisions look like is it its starting to become a pretty big issue client yes thats actually a good question use cases ends  client you know its not like you know its stopping us from survey its serving other people to do their estate planning but its stopping us to be to be being data driven and then underneath that like what other features that we need to be added what approach to be needed to be added  use cases  client and also like where do we want to spend more you know time and money based on you know what were seeing in the data so those are the ones that are affecting affecting it account executive  okay so pretty a pretty significant problem especially when it comes to maybe putting a stop on revenue opportunities are different tweaks and stuff and and im walking right new revenue new ever know and and where to spend the money thats a big one right client yeah yeah a good a good use cases like you know were spending money on facebook you know but were also spending money on you know on google right  search types  client but then google you know facebook has more conversions in google so why are we putting number percent on google or facebook you know those kinds of situations account executive  yeah do you have any idea right now as far as like kind of an roi or really whats going on with with google and facebook or is it were spending money were kind have  search types ends  client kind account executive  of gauging like hey i think facebook was really hot this we google is hotclient in terms of numbers of you know im not gonna be directly connected to the spend part on the marketing but i know i know theyre looking for like you know those kinds of things account executive  perfect and thats an awesome awesome use case i mean just you know a couple right off the bat really marketing could use it to help prioritize where theyre spending their money how much money theyre spending the end user being able to to not have to bombard do sir client yeah with,0.9974,0.189,0.021,0.79
low,won,about company,account executive  with questions and dashboards ill just give you a little a little insight obviously company right we we run different campaigns we do different marketing and our our marketing team loves loves company because they know exactly how much you know what was spent on this campaign what could have been done or what can we do next time to bring in more value this is a complete waste of time were not doing it anymore without company its kind have to guide you through daisy its i think theres or it takes four weeks and third party vendor to actually get that information but the biggest issue with third party vendor  like you said is if we have a two week backlog right by the time we get the customer the report stuff changed a lot changes in two weeks when it comes to data right making decisions so no i i couldnt agree with you more there definitely well be able to help help you out there and as far as a tool so are we planning on keeping third party vendor  are we planning on some setting third party vendor  what is the timeframe look like are we is this a big client cut it out yeah account executive  he goes whats the timeframe look like are we looking to to have something in place here pretty quick what is the budget look like client so were looking at several factors here obviously by the beginning of q of next year you know we wanna make a decision of like you know whats going to be you know the got the tool that were gonna use for that you know for next year that will help us you know the data driven more data driven,0.9927,0.178,0.045,0.778
low,won,pricing,client and number two you know what are the things you know cost wise you know like were also looking at that you know making sure that you know its not costing us you know money more money that makes us like  steps backwards that name and number two so you know we want this to be like self serving and you know a number for like you know if if its something thats like we dont need to integrate you know  or  other tools to make this work you know that would be awesome  pricing ends  client so if its like account executive  hi there client i i think you know where im going for  pricing  account executive  dont want to integrate a bunch of tools so you mentioned something thats not super expensive only reason i ask is everyone has i mean ive worked with you know everyones different when it comes out right if someone was that you know hey the house houses super expensive well for me that might be you know number right if i asked him i asked him id say number now to use our house is like number and thats dirt cheap right so do you have have they have they released the budget have they given you any kind have id on on on what could be allocated  pricing ends  account executive  and the reason i say that im gonna ill definitely show you company and and be be a champion for you as well within the organization and oftentimes what we see is you know lets just say we had and im just throwing this out for easy numbers right lets say we had a budget well if that bi tool solved all the backlog helps us with our marketing helped us with this but it also helped us with different things in the organization that maybe we werent thinking about before theres some flexibility  pricing  account executive  have they given you just a ballpark amount like are we talking you know number for a tool number for a tool you know kind of where where yall stay in their client nothing nothing like significant like nothing creek i dont know like number for a tool you know that kind of thing  pricing ends  client yeah because again you know like bi tool is the third party vendor is just bi tool okay you know all it does is they get a visual of it account executive  yeah client right i mean i can account executive  lot different than than third party vendor  client yeah like you know i can build them a bi tool we just take time you know versus the shift by one and then you know put you somewhere in other words you know if its something thats like you know its a bi tool but also like l tool i tool thats also an extraction tool at all in because that means i dont have to integrate other tools thats why we are display you a bi tool you know that kind of thing so those are like you know those are like no charity set up but account executive  yeah client but the the main point is you know like we are currently looking at our bi tool or our bi you said intelligence its not working as its supposed to perfectly so thats why you know lets tackle you know we want to tackle that so if its youknow if it will put us like you know number steps forward and then we look at other things too you know,0.9988,0.214,0.016,0.771
low,won,company product,account executive  yeah and i think the big thing too is like you mentioned is with third party vendor  it takes a lot of manpower right it takes a lot of back end power like yourself and maybe some others in the organization that are having to spend their time to do these add hawk request so a lot of it comes down to as well as whats the most whats the most we can get out of right and not have to have you know  people on the back end creating all this which is also a cost right you know manpower so client yeah we  industry issues ends  v  can help out so that you all can spend your time doing what youre supposed to do and up level kind of your career within the organization right and and drive new business initiatives and stuff versus having to sit there and hey lucy in sales im gonna get you that new dashboard right so client yeah this will give you a background like where a number man team on the data part we have a data i would say we have like a two back end developer including me so and then we have one financial analysts and then the other guy is an added this to for for the application itself,0.9705,0.121,0.0,0.879
low,won,company product, okay client but also where a back end account executive  okay so what im getting is you know were not necessarily looking to go and hire  right   people in the back end data resources and we need something that where we you know we can do a little bit of work with it and then its you know here you go dive away ask whatever questions you want pull whatever data you want without having having to spend all of our time doing that so thats thats definitely were going to help out so let me let me do this ill go ahead and show you just because you know youll have third party vendor  right  data architecture  account executive  or a cloud data where else for that matter we have to have that to work and the reason i originally asked you that is when it comes to integrations and such we actually sit on top of third party vendor  we dont even ingest the data we sit on we sit on top of third party vendor  and we can analyze everything in there right  data architecture ends  account executive  so thats thats the nice piece about that when i when i say that and what ill do too here after this im im taking notes here im gonna remember to send you this client awesome account executive  we actually have a seminar or a little event if you would coming up here here shortly and its called gar right its called to get up and running so its actually shows you within  minutes sometimes less than that we can actually connect to your third party vendor  get up and running and start asking questions done  minutes so as far as setup goes yeah i would definitely join because if you do will actually send you you can actually get a free pair of custom nike client okay okay account executive for the event so to match your shirt man just in case youre ever standing on your table you can have to use on the side so people still know who you are right so you get the get this repair nikes there as well so let me do this,0.9942,0.157,0.021,0.822
low,won,demo,account executive im going to go ahead and share my screen with you let me know when you can see it okay and and well do a i would like say a high level how to walkthrough  to it clientaccount executive  when it gets down to the real technical piece im not the most technical person myself and ive got solutions engineers and everything that will  agenda ends  client i get it i get it go account executive  with yeah lets see client alright here we go i see it account executive  sure our database so we can see everything here okay so this is the main like it right here home screen right so youll see its how it looks a lot different right  search types  account executive  its very interesting so what we do here like i said company really begins its its bi journey after the dashboard right after the dashboard and so were going to give our consumers and customers that removed on pinterest flavor right you got the removed search you kinda got a pinterest steel over here with highly curated personal data experience and also super awesome white boards  pinboard  account executive  and ill show you what that means here so lets just hop in lets go here lets hop into sales performance so these are live boards okay the reason we dont call it dashboards sorry excuse mean i dont know if youve seen seen a bunch of our stuff is that is youll youll see the probably for your company as dashboards or data right so these are live boards for instance ive got monthly sales here if i came and check this two days later these numbers are going to be different okayyeah so its its real time its live ill scroll down and show you a little bit of what we got here sure it looks familiar  agenda  client yeah account executive  okay so what i wanna do is im going to dive in and what im doing right now is im an end user right yep so i im not super technical so this is how it kind have a workflow would almost look like kind of give you an idea or a taste so im just gonna hop in here cool lets hop into sales trends gonna open it up  agenda ends  account executive  so now im im analyzing this year right awesome i see everything ive got everything but but wait a second what if i dont like the way this looks right then then im reaching back out to use and saying hey you know can you put this in it and another way is this is its not telling the data story i need to tell from the way its looking i can actually go right up here and i can just change it to a stack column done within a matter of clicks so can you can you kind of shed some light on how youre how your users are kind of creating their own data story today  data drill down  client okay so like you know your use case right now so one of one of the things is you know you kinda did a drill down so like okay all those the green the green as part of it i want to explore that data so like lets say okay i wouldnt look at july july looks pretty be anybody also like if i was an end user i want to drill down like okay whats the demographic or like you know whats inside that greenness yeah account executive  and what youre saying is is right now theyre not able to do that correct or even sit there and change the visualization theyd have to go back client i mean you know anybody you know in third party vendor  you can change the visualization would would be one but then for the end user is that they want to drill down on the data lets say okay im looking at july and i wanna look at you know that green the green this data so i want to be able to like drill down account executive  gotcha okay lets do this lets make this interesting so im gonna kinda show you something else thats cool from an end user standpoint so ive got nothing right okay so im sitting on top company sit on top of third party vendor  im sitting here lets just say im looking you know lets say sales right and youll see as im typing it pops up right there right so i got sales ive got daily ive got lets put it in region and then lets through lets throw a wrench in it to input last six months client okay okay account executive  i can i can grab whatever im looking for last six months lets go ahead and hit go there we go okay so im looking at this right and this is something if i wanted to see right they would have to ask you if there wasnt already report so one ive ive just been able to go get what im looking for and lets say this looks interesting right so what im gonna do is im going to right click im gonna hit drill down and lets look at it from a city standpoint client yeah yes account executive  ive got in cities ive got all my cities there and just for time purposes like i said we can do more in depth i dont want to  about company  client yeah account executive  we can go as granular as you want when i say granular to give you just a little bit inside of that who lou is actually one of our big customers you know who we liked the streaming service client yepaccount executive  they had an issue third party vendor third party vendor  and then these guys could get on a super granular level and the amount of time they need to if at all they actually use company to go all the way down to the clicks per millisecond of their users to be able to improve their platform so when i say granular we can go as much as you need it too right  data drill down  client yeah account executive  so right here just to kind of go back ill do this drill down and lets just look at a skew for the store okay so we can go as granular as you want client wow okay and you know what attracted us also we talked about this that you your ui l like built in on it so maybe thats something that you know we can look at a demo with you know name yeah yeah  name  account executive  yeah yeah so ill just kind of shed some light on that real quick this little white board that says name analysis client yeah account executive  easiest way to explain this and like i said i can bring my solutions engineer on to go into the weeds of it with you but its like taking number little kids running around them all grabbing stuff and then bring stuff back and giving it to you itll actually go spot trends so automates the process of comparing thousands of scenarios across billions of rows of data  name ends  client wow okay thats pretty coolaccount executive  yes so thats that can help you spot things that maybe you didnt realize maybe it spots you know marketing hey you guys are spending yeah theres a lot of money getting pumped in here and not a lot of return why are we doing this right its gonna help kind of help emilys families snap that pain there if you would and and catch things that maybe youre not or it could bring up stuff where youre like holy cow i never talked to look at it like that right so same kind of thing here  data drill down  account executive  what ill do is ill just go ahead and clear this out and well look at another example ill just put it in sales by product type and youll see as im going and its pulling stuff up for me and then lets just look at east versus west okay i can hit go its got it all for me client thats pretty cool account executive  i can change i can change once again i can change the visualization and how it looks i can really do whatever i want to do and with you being a being a pretty technical guy yourself i want to show you this i can click on keywords heres whats going on  data drill down ends  account executive  so anyone can use it that doesnt understand sequel code anything like that our system is extremely intuitive on the back end and does all this for you client okay thats pretty cool account executive  to give you a call yeah so to give you some context lets say we want to know whats going on right  data drill down  account executive  and the reason we do this too is its data accuracy will hop on query details i can actually show you the sequel that was just ran based off of what i typedclient okay one last quick question from me so like when you do a drill down the have to set up that drill down up or is it like detected v  what do you mean set the drill down client well i mean you know how how do you say account executive  how do you drill down how do you have all this and just drill all the way down to what you need to yep so we we go off of and and my my solutions engineer can touch a little more on that but we go off of whats called worksheets and it takes so you you can basically pull all the lineage and everything is already is already there right  data drill down ends  account executive  so that yeah so its gonna sit on top of third party vendor and itll be able to analyze and youll be able to make connections with whats going on  data drill down  client okay account executive  and client then account executive  yeah and he said he can touch more on that for you and then when you see just the sales by product type out east versus west how it pops up ill show you another example on a second there is a reason it pulls that up is its our system saying based off of an identified group of users marketing sales whatever it may be data drill down ends  account executive  this is typically what youre looking for the most right so its almost like removed where you start typing in you know restaurant and then it pulls up near me does that make sense client yup yeah the the use case i can use on this is like an ab testing yeah so i wanna see how one thing performs outperforms the other you know that kind of thing cool  data management  functions  account executive  yep and then just kinda give you a little bit of an idea here on whats going on heres the query visualize or so youve got your fact table one or two then tables client okay got it now i know how how it works okay got it account executive  so im im instead of doing all this im searching and its pulling it up for me its doing the same thing right so  data management  functions ends  client okay account executive  pretty powerful tool there do you do you have any does this look like kind of what youre what youre talking about as far as the easier client well im account executive  surveysclient yes this is what this is what im looking for actually to be honest can you tell me you know like a brief of like you know whats your pricing points you know make you know,0.9999,0.188,0.014,0.798
low,won,pricing, pricing  account executive  so we have a couple of different options and we can dive into that as well it really depends when i say depends one more flexible into we have a couple of different pricing models okay okay we have we have a capacity model and then we have a consumption model so capacity model is going to be based off of the amount of data that youre analyzing and we dont were not your typical like pay per user or pay per license so with the capacity thats unlimited users right client okay account executive  so youre paying for the amount of data that thats that company is analyzing and then we have our consumption model as well which is more use space right so you have your users and its like i said we will we can kinda get more than that the consumption model theres theres a lot to it but its basically based off of how much youre consuming okay what youre using it client can we have account executive  we have different data and stuff on you know different business sizes in kind of an average of how much youre using across how many users but thats kind of our our pricing our pricing model there but like i said were were flexible on and its you know okay next next meeting we can hop into that too and actually pull the reason i say that ive gotta go to my my team and get like a you know quote and everything based off of the information but we can actually sit there and help you analyze what would make the most sense for your business the reason i say that is take who lou right i think theyve got i dont know like number or number right rows of what of what theyre analyzing the capacity model does it make sense right that would be very expensive for all that but the consumption model does make a lotta sense and they purchase it essentially in buckets of credit data architecture  clienttranscript  got it so kind of credits and on one last question in terms of the data you you guys said that you sit on top of third party vendor  correct so that we feel own the data and all that like you guys just do the query and the exact account executive  we we cant mess with any of your data and third party vendor or anything ,0.9629,0.089,0.043,0.867
low,won,demo,account executive  we simply just sit on top of it and thats the reason we do that too we dont even ingest the data we just sit on top and analyze it so when it comes to you know data governance and things of that nature your data is your data client okay and you dont you dont extract the data nope no okay got it account executive  right yeah so like a third party vendor or third party vendor or some of those where you have to pull in data we dont do that we actually sit on top of that we dont ingest any of the data whatsoever client okay alright alright so i wonder whats the next steps you know and how we can have the next steps coming in  data management  functions ends  account executive  yeah yeah for sure i want to show you one more thing before we before we hop there and the reason i want to show you this is once people start using it theres a lot of information this is another cool piece lets say i dont even want to go into i dont even want to go into a full on search  data drill down  account executive i just want to be able to search with whats going on or whats been there i can say show me my top stores i can hit search looks like theres my top  stores i can buy sales i can pull that up now lets say i want to add some stuff this is awesome but i want to look once again the ip s the select select a suggestion this is based off of me personally what i typically will look at right or a group of users so lets just say i want to do last quarter great i got last coordinator and lets say i wannaadd quantity purchase i can add quantity purchases as well so its very very flexible very easy to use now lets say i wanna i wanna hop back in and really be able to start slice and dice this however i want i can go here client thats good account executive  and then boom im right back to the original view that youd seen when we first started where i can actually exit out and change different things in here  agenda  client wow okay wow so very cool impressive yeah account executive  yeah so so next steps im gonna stop sharing my screen hold myself back up so so really really next steps from here what i would wanna do is is bring my solutions engineer on to be able to answer any kind of technical questions you may have but also show you the the the back end of the of the system right  agenda ends  account executive  our worksheets how we build worksheets how we go from literally nothing to be able to search information you can actually show you that within a matter of mi,0.9975,0.193,0.005,0.802

low,won,deployment options,account executive  but definitely i would definitely explore your options stuff thats just something i would i would throughout and theyll be candid with you there to third party vendor is also a great tool same thing though within third party vendor youre still youre building dashboards within third party vendor client yeah account executive  so its its once again its a its a you know i mean its one half  the other so like i said were a full full selfservice when it comes to that but what we can do here too as far as the the next meeting is that something that just you would be on or do you want to bring in any counter client cards account executive  or making a decision how does that work is it yeah client its a multiple people involved so i got i got to bring in you know my know my team for this its going to be name and name and the email domain is client with account executive  yeah so name you and name will be on the next one thats here  onboarding process  client yes yes account executive  okay and then just so i can kind of understand as far as an end user goes is it would there be a so if we when we do kick off a plc one thing we like to do right a proof of concept one thing we like to do is kinda like i just did almost a brief overview with some of the end users are testers if you would that would be using it that way we can briefly show them hey heres how you know heres how you search heres how you change the visualization things of that nature onboarding process ends  account executive  so we would definitely want to show them that as well and then just to kind of understand the the buying the buying process right what what is this what does this come down to is that something that you name and name say yeah your name or is there a lot of other people involved that are going to need to see the front end the back end of the solution  industry issues  client it so if you think about a name is actually the the end user part of it and then and then name would be the you know the one building to building the dashboards or visualizations or analyzing the data even with just though account executive  okay so thats whats awesome she wont have to building the dashboards or do anything like that im only thing that it only thing that we need to do is get worksheets and stuff setup,0.998,0.174,0.0,0.826

download the trace but so you know that this user name and password works and you know that that user has the role that specified yes okay and the account name so what is the full third party vendor

left of third party vendorclientnameyeah everything there yeah and you dont need the https just that andthe account nameaccount nameclientname data drill down sales engineerive seen it done like this and ive also obviously see that widget proper namesname yeah so if its in third party vendors y west region it could be a proper name because they dont thats like the default regionright all rightall right were home freeyeah fornow thank godclientsales engineerclientnamenamesales engineernamebut any other region you need to get that region id and they have there we go data architecture no problem no i you know i can i can stay on and just in case theres any other questions but yeah thats great lets go onsales engineer which which which database where youthinking of usingnameclientwe have a replicated a query that were using to pull live data out of and third party vendor its in its in our data warehouse right now but data management  functions client prep orders its a highly d normalized view is that okaysales engineer yeah you just kinda wanna go up there and select that top column name checkboxthats onesales engineerperfect well thats super easy just to create connection data management  functions ends clientand were off to the racessales engineernameclientsales engineeryep and is so thats it and is this the primary yet right here theres noclientyeah i mean itll be down the road the way other stuff i want to add and we can have that conversation but for now this has everything we needand this takes a minute because essentially company going in and getting all of the met a data for this table from third party vendor so actually did a pretty quick and you can so you notice you can just go up right to the upper right hand corner and click search now and itll take you right into you can start typing in column names from thatokay if you remembersales engineerand if you dont wanna type if you click on that prep underscore orders areaclient yep this brings up a list of columnssales engineer see the list of columns as wellclient okaysales engineer pop up stuff but you can leave that open and still type it and youll get that indexing search kind have a guided search if you will as well so im not only here but also in the in the actual search for search types client so this is a this is more for searching at this point im not sure i understoodsales engineerclient okay what im doing now the basically just query in the data with a search barsales engineer yeah so its hang up i have my as you type it in up there in the search bar youre going to start getting answers two years not answers but like search types ends name  gonna start giving you suggestionssales engineer im sorry and if you see one like maybe its in production date and thats what you were looking for you can you can tab over and now if you wanted to see in production date by a certain metric you would start begin typing in that metric or some other attributesales engineer there you go and now so by default we have the auto search turned off so that it has as your so when i usually do my demo i have it turned on so every single word i hit enter on in the search bar is sending a query to third party vendor but by defaultto reduce costs we turn that off right so i can come in here and build out my answer or my search and then go over to the blue what do you call it last to to execute thatclient all right so what if i wanted to look at like some of you know a partner item costs by partner but i would do i type in byehere you younamesales engineer can or you can just type in partnernamepartner name looks like whichclientand then if i wanted to do that for say just maybe the month of october  sales engineercould type in october assuming there you go right so now youre youre witnessing the auto indexing thats taken place there right october pop down and it gave you the choice to make sure is it in production day or is it some other date field that might be in thereclient and where it is that if i want it how does it know that is   if there are two octobername insales engineer    and hello yep now you can hitclient okayname or you couldsales engineer have you could have also because you had all of your in production dates in there you could have just done either way is correct but you could have gone in production date partner item cost partner enter brings it back and then you could have filtered your answer afterwards to just october  as wellclientgot it so at this point if i want to see the results justenter surename data architecture nameso right now its its actually running a query if you were to go into your third party vendor council youd see that theres a query running to get that dataclient yeah mostly the started the warehousenameover in the his in the history if you go to the history tabnameso what what youre seeing here is a bunch of queries that are in the background data management  functions name so when you when you connected to that table in the background company started building out the what we call the search index which does select from there but you can see here all the all the courses running data architecture name if you i think if you hit refresh itll show you the the live query thats running client whereas the refresh around herename far far right theres a little got it there you go theres and unfortunately our query that were trying to run is queued up behind the sub queries name name so thats why were i mean so if you go down to that i on the right side itll query that ran against third party vendor if you go to the ui and then down to the bottom for a sequel itll show you now because you selected date and didnt give it a like a a grain name ends name it just assume monthly okay theres theres one way that you could change that if you go to close this and then backup to that search bar go ahead and hover over the in production date at the beginning and x that close that out and at the end now go back to the the end of it and type the word daily data drill down name and as you start to type daily its going to give you the different before actually hold on start typing it but dont finish and ill explain whats happeningsales engineer backspace a little bitname so backspace so now you get to pick the date data drill down ends name now it i guess theres only one dates yeah it just worked so yeah they hit daily and then go ahead and hit enter that will give you a slightly different view on the data because i think it was trying to do monthly instance there was only one month it just kinda thats right and have anything to display the dot data drill down sales engineerclient so what theyre gonna do with partner name and this is theyre gonna try to create a stacked bar for cut it by partnersales engineer if you go to the gear above the roi it actually didnt visualize it now what you could do is drag it up and have it sliced or you could actually change the visualization here as well okay data drill down ends clientname so if we wanted to see the different partners the trends for the different partners you could drag it in or you know the other option would be to just delete again the daily and then what itll do is itll show you the pattern costs by partner without having the so if you hit enter now itll change to a bar chart once it renders with the names data drill down name and so now if you wanted to say hey i only wanna see the top five it looks like theres not a lot going on theresales engineer you can type that right in the search bar clientname yeah you can add the word top five and then that way space in there yep yessales engineer and just for informational purposes if you type in just top it defaults to top  but you can do top one through whateverokay alright thats pretty coolclientsales engineerso im thinking if you type in i dont wanna you type in daily againclienthere yep im on the search bar data drill down ends sales engineer the search bar you yeah youd enterdrop partner name againclientsales engineerand drag partner up to slice with color i dont think im doing that right but well give it a try anywayname i think that i think thats right i think thatll give us what were looking for problem is different days have differentclient  hi dave because thats the top fivesales engineer yeah yeah yeah yeah thats exactly it there are there are absolutely ways to get more than one trend line on there as well and and as as we dig into this i can help you squared away and what kind of charge you want and all that fun stuff,0.9996,0.13,0.019,0.851
low,won,demo,clienthello okayup inaccount executivenamehere now its just so so because you have more than  customers or partners sorry you have more than number or with the partners and its trying to slice by number so i was saying so yeah again theres theres a way in the syntax to say top five partners by partner call partner item cost instead of top days we had the we had the wording a little wrong and so it render the wrong thing but theres a way to limit the customers down to a smaller set but yeah i think you get the idea of of kind of how you play with it and yeahaccount executivesales engineer hello client as as another one lets say like one of these spikes are valleys you wanted to drill in data drill down sales engineer im not sure what you want to drill into but all you gotta do is hover over it right click and hit drill down and youll get a list of all those attributes data drill down ends sales engineer so if you wanted to go into state city zip or what have you you could do that or any of them carrier or you can type in there and itll bring it up there you go partner name and if you dont right and you can also actually if you go into the far left access there you see where it has been a little carrot click on that okayclientsales engineer yup and you could sort this the sending or whatever annual annual you know you just just another way to look at the data right so now youve got likethe top everything right and you can even fit the number to the to the screen as well versus the scroll bar name sales engineer like you see there and down at the bottom theres a scroll bar because of number data pointsclientlong tail probably is not as useful right drops off significantly down herewhat elsethat i want to so we didsales engineeraccount executivesales engineerthe other thing is maybe you dont want a pretty picture you see where youve got a little button up here thats got the blue yeah click on the table view or click on that button data drill down sales engineer and this is sticky so if you just want to operate in a tabular view you can do that as well okayclientsales engineer the auto visualization is the other way and if you just click it again itll go back so you can you can toggle that switch back and forth got it okay i just toggleclientsales engineer yep and then just above the gear but you see the same visualization button if you click on that you can choose what type of visualization you want okayclientsales engineer but lets go back so this is kind of some look and feel and we can set up some office hours to do more data management  functions sales engineer but lets go back to the data tab because i do want to show you some other stuff in there as well before we let like pure end users go at this so youve got your prep orders the retail apparel demo is this something that it ships with i put a tag on it this morning so that we could differentiate between what you guys are doing and what ships your tag data management  functions ends clientsales engineer yeah thats my and so what we wanna do is go up to the ellipsis over in the far right around button there click on that and lets say lets create a worksheet and if you go to the left and create and click on sources i guess at the end up and then grab your table yeah prep orders close that and now if you open it on yep right there lets just say out of all of this there was only  or  records that you really wanted to give certain users you can not records but columns you can select them that you wanna use by double clicking them or highlighting as many and then clicking add columnsclient  or control and click the there you gosales engineer yep and yeah right because some of these probably you dont you dont i dont i dont know right but certainly lets also definitely pick a city state zip and countryclient leave it up for i end up selecting everything sales engineer now you can hit add columns there at the very bottom right below product you just lost itsorry thats all right yousee just belowclientsales engineerclientyup mitigate a few or they select that i can always come back and add to our rightsales engineer yeah but definitely do the geo ones because i want to show you something specific about thosegocity state zip countryclientsales engineerand product right right below product to see add columns right there youclienti miss crap quantity as well alright add columnssales engineersir outstanding now lets hit save button give it a namesales engineerperfect the other thing that you can do in a worksheet that i didnt mentioned i should have below the sources there was a formulas if i wanted to add formulas to this worksheet its just a spot that everybody that has access to this worksheet will now have that kind of global formulaclient doingsales engineer a one off in a report or an answer but in here you see right or the aggregate are the aggregations correct and then the next one is synonyms so partner name order number product quantity i can add in that synonyms column a comma the limited list of what people use and there every day verbiage to describe these things got it so yeah like search types clientsales engineersales engineer like the one i usually show is you know is it is it is it a fraud product skew item right you can just eliminate list and then the net and this is important for those non technical end users that you know what language do they use data drill down sales engineer and that just makes the search experience way more pleasant then for that auto visualization if you go over to the geo for state zip or country city obviously is is an endpoint to a drill in from a zip or something but for what where are we on i think it was state state whats that data drill down ends clientsales engineer click on sub nation or so yep sub nation announced stateclientsales engineeryep and then zip code and thenclient no we have lots of dirty data in here sosales engineerso defaults doubles its default as a measure when it comes inthats fineand then country yeahokaysave thatnamesales engineeraccount executivesales engineerclientand turn off phases measures since its the order numbersales engineeryeah yeah yeah you cannot change that to an attribute first and then d select additive and the aggregation its gonna tell you you need to change as well you dont have to go exactly in that order butgot it i safeclientsales engineersave and now if you go back to search right choose sources youll see in the top the upper part where it says worksheets theres your tests view and justclient yousales engineerselect the prep bordersturn this off okay data drill down clientsales engineerclientsales engineeryep and then hit close now your normal end users only ever going to see worksheets right okay and probably only one or two because were admins we see the entire entirety of it so now yeah you can open that up and if you say a quantity by country or something or quantity and countrysales engineer actually double double click it or type it right into the search bar i look at already you know and youre youre gone quiet and then country and hit enter i probably should have checked your we do that thats pretty coolclientsales engineer right and now just as a task lets drill down into the united states and go to stateright rightsales engineerhi click yeah i think we might have just gone tosales engineeralright so it looks like youve got state does that stateclientclientsales engineer looks like and then you know if you drill down to that you could even go to zipssales engineer and you only have one so if you switch over to tabular view its funny because i was literally just doing this the other day the same the same thing where it was only a couple of zips in the state that were in are there it is quantity three if you wanted to you could actually drill on this and go into like order number or item or product or or do we have vendorclient yeah so i guess my bigger question is like why did we only see state when we drill down from united statessales engineerlets kill this if you go to the x on the search barkilled all thingclientsales engineeryep and throw united states in there and our state through thrown state in there just type in state enter data drill down ends sales engineer lets see what we get here well thats why it says well you know why did we only see me a favor and say actually go down to state in the actual column here nope over over in the answer side yeahclientsales engineer and hit that ellipsis and just filter that i want to see something and actually you know what im gonna do im gonna just request control aswell yepi see what youre sayingokaysales engineerclientaccount executiveclientwhats the issue all possible values that show everything for the samplesales engineerread my mind right when i was sitting here slightly pharma and then i was like here we go this is probably why why its notwowthats pretty crappyyeahsales engineerclientclientsales engineerhes in here right my guess would be that its something to do withlets see this real quickso hes the auto searchsales engineersales engineersales engineeryeah itll be interesting to see how how it works with because im sure like you got em i state and there was mir up here multiple times so im not chit could very well beclientsales engineer it may it might have just totally confuse the map to a certain degree so it might have been a i would want to confirm what were looking at from a country perspective on quantity enter on this and lets you it its definitely pretty youre looking at it at the map though isnt it data drill down client  it is makes for a great demosales engineer absolutely there there may need to be a little bit of work on that and i can look at that behind the scenes as well not to get bogged down in this completely like totally take a look at this because i have access as im sure you know as an admin to this to this as wellsales engineersales engineerbut for quantity thats all you have seems does that seem odd based on theclientyeah i mean youre not filtering data anywhere so that seems really oddsales engineeryeah id have to check the data because it looks like right i just said show the underlying data when theres only two records for united states country data drill down ends sales engineer data drill down  yeahsales engineersales engineer right so you could actually we wanted to take this and see what the returns and third party vendor but this is exactly where its coming from so theres only theres only three records and then if i drill down to state here statesales engineerclient hi is this hitting third party vendor every time we see those sort of three bubbling dots yes and nothings getting cash anywhere its not like were catching up with data along the way data architecture sales engineer were indexing these values and whatnot but were not moving the data over and theyre not caching as far as i know name mayname right no other queries should be run in real time against the data thats in your third party vendor so you can paste those you can you know paste those queries directly out of our interface intoaccount executive  third party vendor and run them yourself there data architecture ends sales engineersales engineer is there maybe another metric that you guys use quantity stageclient quantity is the only thing i have another view right now i mean thats thats just part of that we look at revenue and profitabilitysales engineer yeah because its just theres i mean according to this theres theres only data for united states for state with quantity for those time periods we look at any quantity and what is it delivered day and production date is there a day that mightclient would they were you using just a new quarter create date thats the data to you working man june  clientsales engineersales engineer yeah something ill definitely have to look into because like you just like we just saw right when i true in that order create date theres plenty of data and data yepclientsales engineer and theres all the zip codes you can see its definitely its some its the one the one nice thing about this is without having to write sequel you can see the bad data right right and start interacting with it right so when i drilled into state why am i getting this up here and and this so i have a sneaking suspicion that its just the quality of the data we can obviously still work with it but it could be it could be sketchy from time to time here did not like apparently state except for the mapping data management  functions client you dont need to bog down in the mapping that we only have a few more minutes whats the i want to join a table you could just walk me through thatsales engineer yeah absolutely so if you had the joins done theres the top three in state if you had the joins done using the primary keys foreign keys in third party vendor and you selected those tables they would automatically come in as joined okayclientsales engineer if you want to join them in in company you see this joined button right here say i had multiple tables that we had brought in already i can just add those joins right here heres my source table select your other table whatever it might be and then select the column that it that it actually joints to you right obviously this table is not related to an all but you get the ideayepclientsales engineerand if its more of a compound join you can add columns here as wellclientokay and that just becomes part of this d normalized viewsales engineerit would just be joined on that to this d normalized view data management  functions ends sales engineerand then to to your point what you would do like this test view i would have to edit this and add that new calm i mean add that new okayclientsales engineer right so if i if i come out here and i add this table lets say itll itll add it but because theyre not joined its going to be great outclient got it okaysales engineer and heres the formulas as well you can come in here you can just start typing theres assistance as well whats kind of neat though is lets say i wanted to do a quick one as i start typing maybe ill say i want to do quantity see how it just starts popping in there like a leads leads leads leads the way so i can do quantity times i dont know product whatever it is and you have all sorts of different aggregate type calculations you can do count if some if sounds you have all your standard kind of if then else all that fun stuffclient heres a question just real quick on a formula to one is is there an assumed level of granularity that its calculating the formula on is it calculated at the role levelsales engineer yeah i believe so yes right so like it was interesting because yesterday i was dealing with a customer and they had used they had used this this aggregate aggregate i think they use the group aggregate for something and all that was was they wanted to take out they had fees and they wanted to sum that up slightly differently and literally all they had to do is say some if they didnt i have to do an aggregate if if you want to calculate add an aggregated level then you have to create that aggregate level right so its something from the transaction level on up across all of your all of your own attributes so if you need to do something more advanced and i need to calculate some so states or the zips are the cities whatever that granularity is in regional automatically go off the country right i want to calculate something differently at the country level then you need to use that aggregate kinds of functionalityclient okay so the second question on the formula is is that only relevant to this data source now that were its only relevant the studiosales engineerclientsales engineer this worksheet yes okayyes theresclientsales engineer thats correct and this worksheet is just a logical layer sitting on top of that prep borders table from third party vendor and its only attached to this worksheet or this test view as we call themclient okay so if i created you know client company good and gross profit as opposed to maybe our partners gross profit would i id have to do that in every worksheet that i created where were where were gonna use calculate profitsales engineerclientno way to really centralize our govern use of calculations across worksheetsales engineertheres not a concept of a global metric that you can just plop and pick wherever you want to worksheet right now use cases sales engineer its only at the worksheet level i believe thats on the road map but right now its only into worksheet levelclient okay well thats helpful i mean a lot of what we do centers around this view at least as it relates to managing our our backlog our productivity our supply chain but those metrics will apply and other places as well use cases ends sales engineer  sure yeah absolutely they always dok yeah okay i dont i went on our our time i whats the recommended way to really start digging in here and replicate some of the stuff that weve weve builtsales engineer yeah absolutely i mean essentially right you saw how easy it is to get connected assuming that we have our our account name correct yup,0.9999,0.132,0.028,0.84

low,won,demo,clientsales engineer and yeah i was i was looking i was dealing with a customer yesterday you know somebodys going through the same process as you are right now and they literally ended up taking some third party vendor dashboard that they had and say alright well this is kind of what people want pinboard sales engineer lets lets go ahead and see if we can create this but keep in mind no the the idea is not and i had i explain this to them as well the idea is not to necessarily replace although obviously wed be candid on many levels what is to give people a place to get answers not create perfect kind of dashboard or or production type reports rightclientclientsales engineer so create that sandbox of answers and yeah see see see how it feels with regards to the ease of use speed and all that fun stuffclient okay so it sounds like it makes sense to create a worksheet and sort of have a base worksheet or can i work right off of the the view that weve createdsales engineer can do either i think it really just depends on on which capabilities you wanna use right if you want to do an actual formula worksheet is the way to go the geo coding the synonyms all that fun stuff okay i do a lot just found the base tables because i dont need that as part of me you know hammering data management  functions sales engineer yeah but a lot of times folks even if its multiple tables if theyre joined a lot of times before i create a worksheet i can put all three of those tables in that search bar search panel and start searching all three of those even though theyre not connected via worksheet as long as theyre joined data management  functions ends sales engineer okay so yeah you can you can operate as an admin any which way you want as the end users though if you throw end users at this i definitely suggest given them a worksheet and synonyms and im more than happy to go through more of a real kind of of orientation if you will yeah,0.9949,0.173,0.017,0.81

low,won,about company, about company account executive capability for end users and when i say that im sure everyone on this call as has experience things like third party vendor or yall use third party vendor i dont know if youve used their third party vendor search right but it is a true search tool right that that actually works and im thats what im gonna show you here in a second industry issues account executive and ill let me kind of show you the background but thats the beautiful thing about that is being able to to get client and one thing you mentioned was you know some people complain about the pay the options are being able to slice and dice around with third party vendor weve gotta have to find drill paths and things of that nature and then someone might come back and say hey this is awesome but now i have a question on this right so this really does allow them to to get hands on as an end user im also an analyst kind of right the governance and you know giving them the option to see things you want them to see thats relevant to them but being able to actually slice and dice and answer questions themselves and move on about the day that way we we can instead of you know dealing with backlog or anything like that and priorities we can really up level like what were you know whats the strategic initiatives industry issues ends account executive if you would write within the company and the organization so i think especially client client im the team that deals with third party vendor agenda account executive i think you guys are gonna love this so let me go ahead and share my screen and i will start walking us through here let me know when you all can see my screen just to make suresolutions engineer hi im as account executive post or just a validation question you said your data is lives on third party vendor yes okay alright,0.995,0.168,0.022,0.81
low,won,demo, search types clientsolutions engineeraccount executive hello and see my screen here yep perfect so main screen if you would when you log in so what this what this does here is youll see here the search bar right kind of like a removed like search you can see here and it has recommendations etcetera over here pinboard account executive on the right youll see training live boards if you notice i dont know if anyone has been on pinterest but its got kind of a pinterest flavor as well the reason we did this is its familiarity is that are in every day life right everyone uses removed on pinterest instagram facebook things of that nature so we wanted to keep the the ui very simple and easy to use so company really does begin where a traditional dashboard and and ill show you why here so let me do this what ill do is ill just click on sales performance okay this is what we call a live board you can see here im now on the live board side so ill scroll down well hop into these in a second but i wanted to give you an idea probably looks pretty familiar with some things they all seem third party vendor correct yep okaysolutions engineer basically in the live a live borders nothing nothing but a dashboard to talk them forclient gosh forsolutions engineer each of these individual titles you see the column and search because each of them is trying toanswer a questionclientsolutions engineerso a collection of answers creates a live but very the terminology team thats itaccount executiveyep so whats nice about this is lets say im just gonna dive in here on sales trends data drill down account executive so i want to pull it up and youll see up here i clicked on this these like me and he said these were you know answers that were saved to create a whiteboard board right so you can see your sales monthly by product type last two quarters thats what gives us this visualization so lets say im looking at it and im like man this just really isnt appetizing to me i dont like the way it looks i can click this visualization right here and click on stock chunk column chart and itll update it right away so whats cool about this is everyone kind of likes and tell their own data story right in a different way people like to do things differently so you can come in here and you can do a line chart stacked bar chart you know we have heat maps funnels things of that nature obviously some of them you know youre not gonna put it in a line chart or a heat map but you get the idea there of how easy it is to to kind of change out there data drill down ends account executive how does just this right here alone being able to go in and and change different formatting and stuff how does that kind of you know how does that compare to your current you know bi experience todayclient im not sure i want my end users to change the graph data drill down client hey were were trying to give them the best graph type possible because of our training i dont want someone to take a bar chart and make it into a pie chart or i dont i dont know about thataccount executive you mean theyre there and you can set you can set different governance around it but what do you mean by their their training pinboard client well and then user that just looks at a report any they see a line chart yep if you lets put it this way at the end users really dont like the view of a chart you should change the chart the charts should be static it should there should be only one possible well maybe one or two possible best charts for the visualization pinboard ends client and i dont think giving someone my opportunity just change things willy nilly is that i think were trying to give them the best presentation were supposed to know bad as the as theaccount executive gotcha okay ill let me show you on the back end where youd be able to control that then right yeah go ahead and buy pinboard clientsolutions engineerclient i had a quick question does that do these have the feature so third party vendor has a nice feature in which like the end users can save custom views so that whatever changes they wanna make or however they want to order the data i guess in theory if they wanted to change the graph they could save it as a customer view that only they can see or they can share it with others but its not permanently changing the report is this editing the report like live or issolutions engineer yes you have the capability to copy and edit and make your own view in this case account executive is you know he created the dashboard so he gets there that are directly but if we were to share this with somebody else they have the capability to make a copy and then edited so that the master is always you know its not changing the master pinboard ends clientokay but thats creating like a whole nother answersolutions engineerthats correct yeah yeahclientokay so that could get out of control pretty quickly i can i can imagineclientyeah how about answer blowed how do you how do you youaccount executivecan you can governing you can governance control all of that industry issues account executiveso to answer your question yeah if you have predefine things right they could go in and it lets say the reason i say that is it might be different for different users right you know the company systems engineereting team or you know the devops team whatever it might be if i want to go in here and add something else pinboard account executive i can thats not gonna change what you all have meeting created its just gonna allow them to answer you know what they want to answer right without having to to reach back out and if they want to pin that like you said the custom report thats exactly what it is they could go here and pin it to where only they could see it pinboard ends account executive you all obviously the admin will have access but to where they can see and if they want to share it right then they could share it based off of whatever guidelines or governance you all set there youll have full control on the back end of what all the end users can do data architecture ,0.9993,0.148,0.025,0.828
low,won,company product,client so if you have this one answer and its its based on the same set of data and these are all live queries against third party vendor is that correctthats i lead our end datasolutions engineerclientis there any cashing mechanism or extract mechanism like third party vendor or all thatsolutions engineerwe dont i would say cash any data on our sites except for the metal data like the table names and all of the column names but you know if you want to utilize third party vendors cash lets say if you have a query that runs every day without any changes you could probably leverage third party vendor casual there but we we we we only do live creating because we want to give fresh analytics to the usersclientalright so has anyone mentioned the the size of our fact tables to youclientwe we have no we havent talked about that yeah okay,0.9702,0.178,0.016,0.805
low,won,customer base, pricing account executivehow many im interested how many billions of rows do you all have in third party vendorclient godclient really and number itd b enormous alone yeahclientclientclientaccount executiveclient yeah its hard i mean yeah its a hard one to answer i mean we had we had billions of rows a day but yeah i think maybe what client is getting at is that maybe this is something we have to take away is some of our queries,0.726,0.141,0.05,0.809
low,won,company product, data management  functions client so some of our a lot of our stuff is using views and third party vendor and so some of them take a while to to generate data so we take advantage an awful lot of the shared data sources in third party vendor so those you know those third party vendor data sources will reprocess every hour so that reports are super you know very snappy and third party vendor data architecture client and its not query the database for every user query because it would it would be an enormous bunch of resources to do that take you know if you just query the amount of data in our extract in one query like  days one of this one particular data source you would be waiting like an hour if you were looking at a live query versus extract that same set of dimensions and filters you set through the x back will return in seconds so okay our live ability needs to be addressed the live yep performance data management  functions solutions engineer you said youre already doing things like clustering indexing all of those despite thatclient we dont we dont control that and third party vendor as much as we use shared third party vendor data sources and extract the data into third party vendorsolutions engineer okay the because you know we we work with customers who have you know a lot lot of data like in state what we usually see them do is to play some best practices on there data architecture solutions engineer so because its its more of a reason for you to more to live query if you have so much data because youre having to catch that and third party vendor server and all of that might be a little overwhelming at times if you want to manage all those data pipelines and stuff like that data architecture ends solutions engineer so live creating why we feel its its kind of helpful is you know if you have this and scaleable data that you need to cash and a third party to like third party vendor that might lead to more maintenance on your but i think maybe if you havent explored the third party vendor i would say features like they have things like time line creating our i was i was just looking at another customers use case before but there are some best practices we would follow in order to kind of help the the you know like the warehouse to lets find quickly to these requests,0.9957,0.175,0.004,0.82
low,won,onboarding, onboarding process solutions engineer if you feel like thats helpful we could probably have a dedicated session where i can share some best practices on how the probably the major company works in a bedroom it but it just third party vendor instance onboarding process ends account executive and client if i could chime in im to give you context client im glad im glad you brought that up our average return is about seven seconds to give you some contacts like client im sure are you familiar with nameclient entirely yes so thats number one starclient,0.9846,0.303,0.0,0.697
low,won,about company,account executiveaccount executive yep so theyre actually one of our large customers weve got over number users with them if that gives you a context kind of the amount of data they have another one is who name who lose also big customer of ours and they they you know their data theyre down to the millisecond about where people are looking on their product et cetera search types account executive so they query i mean were talking hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of billions of rows and in a matter of seconds so large data sets are you know i mean weve got name other large companies like that too large data sets isnt something that that scares us away or necessarily breaks or slows us down search types ends account executive its more of a hey heres kind of best practices with our customers that have large data sets you know like yall but thats thats not it its not going to be like thats one beautiful thing about company is its not gonna take an hour or two hours to refresher we have to you know extract things into third party vendorsolutions engineer lets see the other thing that you have to keep in mind is also how the bi tool ads and overhead element lightweight like if you were to run a query on third party vendor and then run the same thing on company the the defense its its quite noticeable thats another thing that i love so in my time dealing with third party vendor and company because i you know ive used my bunch of bi group before so maybe thats something you might want to explore they are trying to if you want to go on a trial or something,0.9884,0.135,0.011,0.854
low,won,demo,account executive yep so ill kind of keep keep moving forward here so we can see a you know a little more features and capabilities of this here so what im gonna do is im just gonna go ahead and clear out of this im gonna exit out and ill just put in and this is this this im like demo instance if you what is a retail example but its still gives you you know an idea right data drill down account executive kind of on the on the data that youll be using so ill put it in sales lets put it in daily ill put it in region and ill put it in lets just say last six monthssolutions engineer the search bar here account executive that does using is is is our primary way to build things data drill down ends solutions engineer lets say if you want to build a report the search bar is usually the place where you would go to i would say you know search the answer for in this case all of those colors of the bills indicate what what entity is it data drill down solutions engineer so sales isnt green thats a metric so region as an attribute because its in blue and then the last six months has obviously filter so as soon as as soon as account executive types to query what company theres doing on the back end as to construct the sql query for you know for this search thing that you type and its its basically running and by your third party vendor instance on the flight theyre done in the results picking the best fit visualization and then displaying it to the you know to the user who searched for it and you know transparency is very important for us so you clearly understand which tables are we accessing then relate this query and also you know as account executive show the actual sql query that the agenda rating thats what does it make senseclient yeah thats pretty cool i have a question how does how does this handle data different granularity so like say you have sales for some you know for dresses added daily granularity and you have sales for shoes at an hourly granularity how does that like how does the end user know that when theyre searchingaccount executive glad you asked so youll see here daily right sales daily region last six months but i want to show you this so what i can do here like lets just take this peak right well grab a random peak ill right click on it lets say i want to drill down and i want to go to the city theres no predefined drill pass right so if someone wants to drill down they can drill down right so now it takes me here i in cities lets say i want to go step further i can i can drill down and lets say i want to see the skew number i can drill all the way down to the skew okay and i can keep going further and further and further so thats the powerful thing about company is being able to get to a very granular level extremely quick to be able to figure out like hey what what question i trying to answer search types account executive what you know based off that says i need to make i need the information now i can get there as granular as i want does that give you an idea there on the granularitysolutions engineer yeah client a part of your question is sorted by the keyword that the user types data drill down solutions engineer so lets say if they buy daily and it turns out the the product in this case process have the granularity at an hourly level you know theyre still that company is going to aggregated for the day and then showcase it but there was another way to work around this which is you can specifically tell company the only get the most detail level by default data drill down ends solutions engineer so even if youre by daily its gonna be done i believe thats something we can set on the back end but you know it i hope that answers your question its barking on the keyword and the data you know how what line that the data is it yeahclient data transfer client i think i was thinking more the kind of reverse scenario like what if somebody thinks data is available hourly does it just not show that option when youre searching or lets say they want to hourly but it actually comes in dailysolutions engineer  i mean if youre paying hourly it shouldntclientsolutions engineer okay by the hour but youre saying how do the user know if there was an hourly granularity is that what youre saying yeahclient yeah like say we actually dont have the data at an hour hourly you know greenaccount executive okay i if you dont have the data it wont be there right use cases account executive if if an hourly isnt something that you have there its only gonna be available for what you have anything thats in third party vendor thats whats going to be available yeahclient okay yeah because i think theres some well i think theres like a lot of assumptions that buyers add that because we get some data and like like for us in digital systems engineereting we might get like say facebook data and an hourly grain but we may only get removed or being at like a a daily green theyre gonna make assumptions that they can have everything hourly and i think theres gonna be theres some confusion around that use cases ends client so i dont know if theres any controls in place that just like say if they were to search facebook it will show hourly but if they search removed it wouldnt give them that hourly option in the search bartaccount executive i mean we can we can show them that on the yeah there is controls over that right on the semantic layer kind of the worksheet man if you want to show them that here in a second,0.9982,0.122,0.027,0.851
low,won,company product,solutions engineer yeah what we can do that as you know track the usage behavior thats one thing so lets say you already im used to facebook hourly query before the next time youre type facebook into the search bar you know we track the usage so youll probably get a suggestion that says hourly search types solutions engineer so if you you know if you have that or what account executive is doing from the start like you can close out of the search bar account executive start diving from scratch observe how these usage base suggestions come up so then you type sales company based on the behavior of you as a user and grew it basically suggest these suggestions,0.7506,0.076,0.0,0.924
low,won,company product,solutions engineer so if i were to day bags or you know boston in this case it and basically attract these would be here then if somebody already that hourly and it will surface hourly instead of monthly so thats one one probably the way to mitigate that but like i said on the back end you can basically specify to only look at the detail level even despite lotto under user types on the search bar data management  functions solutions engineer so even if that ideally if the company finds that there was an hourly granularity its kinda by default sure probablyclient it was like yeah so when youre searching here and youre clicking sales is that like instantly scanning the scheme of the table so you know what dimensions you actually have available agenda solutions engineer thats correct sales would only focus if there was a sales call and schemer thats right okayclientaccount executive yep im gonna leave im gonna leave  minutes here for name to actually share his screen and actually dive into the back end and kind of give you all i just wanted to give you an idea of how this works and then have many kind of give you all a and i know this you know it might be overwhelming,0.9799,0.137,0.011,0.852
low,won,demo,account executive i mean which ill say that i mean compare to normal bi tools i mean this is this something that looks pretty interesting are pretty cool you also farclient i think its pretty cool i think the the kind have the see the the sequel creation from the from the search menu is pretty coolaccount executive yeah so what ill do is im gonna leave a little bit of time and ill ill let me show you the ram to the reason like everything thats going on the back end but yeah i mean heres another example of the the query sql so you can see right here as man it was talking data drill down account executive i just put it in product type of sales by product type east versus west reason id shown example in the east versus west is you know maybe different campaigns that your systems engineereting team runs and you just mentioned facebook and removed and stuff like that so im just gives you an idea on maybe where stuff performing where stuffs not right but its its a its you know very simple to type in east versus west all the you know the the sequel that comes along with it versus just typing in i myself i dont know how to write sql whatsoever i mean im an end user myself there so yeah thats thats you know gives you a good idea of kind of the search bar one thing i wanna do too is go back here and maybe ill let you touch on this a little bit as well im just gonna go to the home and im just gonna type in the search bar up here and im just gonna put in this i think this is one thing im client youlllike quite a bit is kind of you want everything defined for them so ill just put it in show me my top storesaccount executive alright so i just pulled up looks like top  stores by sales thats what i want to see and im gonna open it up search types solutions engineer so why do you just says more what we call content search lets say user you know wants to understand if something is already there so that they dont need to build from scratch so they can simply go and pay up on the search bar but company is going to do a similar to removed pinboard solutions engineer its its going to pile up all the relevant results and let the user pick hey is just a visualization youre looking for and if you go back to the previous screen account executive you know the search does not you know not only gets the results for you but it also gives us a preview so that even before you load the dashboard you get an understanding of what the chart looks like in that way you know youre not locked in a notion of kpis if you have does it make senseaccount executive its gonna be like content that you all bill and if im wanting to go find something i can find it here and see exactly what im looking for right and then i can pull it up once i pull it up youll see here its a little different theres no search bar right im searching something thats already been created right and however like i said anything that you create you can governance where if someone does want to change and like i said maybe they dont have you can put governance in there where you just say hey we dont want you all to be able to change the visualization whatsoever but if they do theyre not going to break anything right its essentially making a copy like if you were to copy a excel sheet on a removed doc and then go play with it and do what you want right as far as the the visualization thats how this works data drill down account executive youll see here theres actually suggested kind of filters here right so once again this isnt gonna break anything if and ill show you in a second ill go back and pull back up its going to be exact same but i could put in here lets say iwanna look at last quarter i can click on last quarter and then lets say i wanna look at lets go with quantity purchased it will throw in quantity to purchase as well theyre sending me heresolutions engineeraccount executivesolutions engineer the theres another game changing of company because this visual explanation menu it does our guided by by that what i mean as these attributes are these options that you see at the bottom right these are all based on previous behavior of the user so in this case company not for the fact that i as a store manager would probably benefit if i were to look at instead of the product maybe the regents or product type pinboard solutions engineer so you know these suggestions pilot based on usage and you have and and and the best part is youre not actually messing around with the original visualization this is just im creating i would say another screen if you want to have this other part of the original dashboard you can do it pinboard ends solutions engineer you didnt finish but this is just that visual exploration if you will you could filter you could add elements and youre not youre no longer being restricted to the filters on the dashboard builder hello sign or its not you know because thats usually another request you might see is hey i wanna look at this by adding another measure on another attribute so for things like does this guide and expiration environment is you know it could be very helpful makes it doesnt make sense im im clientclient yeah is the only way to navigate the content through the search bar or can you organize it and like there was a repository structuresolutions engineer we have what we call tags like retails you know lets say you have four departments or the the sales marketing and two others you can have tags andthese tags i love with the kind of have all of the content together not only the pin boards im so lets say that as a data source that are specific to retail okay youll have all of those group together in a tech thats the way we group things insight dot agenda

low,won,company product, agenda account executive mainly i just stopped sharing if you want to pull up your screen so we can kind of start showing him the the back end and the method to the madness theresolutions engineer yeah yeah yeah feel free to you know ask any questions you have so this is the home screen like account executive showed you data architecture solutions engineer i so since you guys are on third party vendor im quickly going to show you what it takes to connect to third party vendor very straightforward we have a data depth that is the one stop shop for everything related to connections you know worksheets as we call all the individual tables from third party vendor data architecture ends solutions engineer and you can also create views internally inside company so that is also something you might want to look at later on but let me quickly go ahead with the connection stamp and lot of connection so youve got name something you know thats the stuff and you in this case you guys are interested in third party vendor you have the capability to either use your service dot com are lets say you have or the access you could either use either of those in this case im just gonna fill my credentials to have a safe trip and its just lets see this call so sorry this was already ready okay but but the connection is fairly simple once youclient i have the same struggles with last pastaccount executiveyeah i use last pass myself and i already have that issue yesterday data architecture account executive maybe we we can always come back and show them like a zero to search id actually connecting to third party vendor and being able to search within you know  minutes or so and another time butsolutions engineer actually i can always show them the different connection that i have access to,0.9812,0.133,0.03,0.837
low,won,demo,solutions engineer so once you set up your credentials we are going to show you i would say a schemer off your existing third party vendor environment you can then basically you know pick the tables you want them to let them and in this case i selected you know these three columns from this table and a couple of other tables but the interesting thing here from maintenance plan to feel is lets say you have some you know lenient defined inside of third party vendor you have joins defined in third party vendor we have another aspect that and headed doors when you bring these tables inside company so if these two tables have happened to have a jain that has in place we were all you know we wouldnt headed that auto populated inside company as well you dont need to be set up jives with what im trying to say make senseclient yeah it makes sense yeah we havent done a lot of foreign key work because third party vendor doesnt obeyed anyways so we never bothered setting them up but yes i get it yeah data management  functions ends solutions engineer okay so once the object so you know brought into company you can then go ahead and create what we call a worksheet now the use of a worksheet is really to make the end user experience a lot more smoother by that what i mean is let me actually show you an example so let me go to one of these answers pardon medical status this is on a help you have an app are understand the use of a worksheet so this just this retail sales l i on the left as a worksheet but you know ive ive city simple query here like medical state of sales by store region data management  functions solutions engineer but if i were to go into the information panel youre gonna see that this is not a simple query im having the access five tables but you know complex joins setup but for the end user they shouldnt have the need to pick columns from five tables so one thing worksheet and others to flatten out the structure you know so that the user can quickly pick the column and then use it in the search yeah absolutely data management  functions ends solutions engineer but and im actually going to go to a sample worksheet to show you what you know what are other things you could do so let me search of the one that we just saw the retail sales and this was the tag i was talking about so you can actually set up many tags and you can filter down the content based on the budget to it back i am so let me actually retail sales okay so a worksheet like i said its a semantic layer that sits in between your original third party vendor data tables and the end user you could add some business logic here im like you know new columns that were never there like a complication you want to construct like a formula im that im client with stock number you can have all of those in this layer you can always expos the end user to create their own formula if you think they are savvy enough its its a very simple i would say editor autofill so if i were to edit this worksheet there is a section that says five minutes so you know these are all calculations simply so if i were to showcase one of these like gross profit i can edit this youre gonna see you know its really a excel based editor like a you know i have my assistance option that allows me to see what all things i could do but you get the idea here right with the fun level yep okay so ones you know you have those farm less setup as necessary you can do other things like we have what we call synonyms so this is where i you know that we you can enhance the search experience so when you type item and the search but you know company knows that hey if a user types item please map back to the original column called product because you have multiple departments calling things in different names you know one one department my colleague revenue but the other might call it saves you see so synonyms as a way to kind of make the search experience fort worth the time and basically we allow you to give totally to synonyms for any column and then alert the user types to send them there you know company its gonna map back to the original column does it make sense the use of synonyms its very powerfulclient yesclient  yeah its definitely an issue we faceaccount executive and to give you some context to this is all like as an end user youre not gonna have access to this this is all gonna be admin you guys that are creating these worksheets and semantic layerssolutions engineerclient can i ask a quick question about worksheets then data management  functions client so is the idea here youre creating like one master worksheet for a whole company that does a company typically have like one master worksheet thats everything in the world or do they have multiple worksheets andwhat water sheets relateto each othersolutions engineerclient,0.9992,0.159,0.004,0.837
low,won,company product,solutions engineeryeah what we usually see people do a lot as they have one worksheet for a use case data management  functions ends solutions engineer so if its related data they have the marketing worksheet and they expose that to the marketing group so you couldnt have technically one worksheet that thats a one size fits all but you know the user experiences is going to be a little weird but yeah that thats what we usually see people do does it make sense okay it use cases account executiveclient makes sense so lets say we have lets say we have two different business units in our company and the stuff is not super overlay like in one area were doing a lot of paper click traffic or pay per click ads and another area were doing more lead generation and the metrics dont the metrics are not you know compatible with each other thats two different worksheets data management  functions client then we would create one for the people working in the ppc rather than one for people working in a lead gensolutions engineer the you said there was no relation whatsoever between theseclient well i mean obviously theres a higher obviously theres a relation of overall revenue must be the underlying granularity users and turner and columns and suffer significantly differentsolutions engineer okay i mean you could have different because you could search up on two different worksheets as long as that as a relation okay so if i were to pick the worksheets and stuff one of the search bar its gonna work as long as you have set up those giant prior its gonna work so i would really want to dig into that a little deeper but the option is that you could search off of multiple worksheets without a problem if the giants are set up right okayclient  you can join between worksheets yeah you can okay okay okaysolutions engineerclientclient that seems like the worksheets function as publish data sources kind of third party vendorsolutions engineer its similar of course obviously these property elements that are not available that but yeah you can you can imagine that can be right butclientclient this is just a structural definition right there solutions engineer yeah like a skeleton this is one of the schedule some added advantage like you know the for example the gl content here could be pretty useful,0.9766,0.129,0.061,0.81
low,won,demo,solutions engineer so lets say you have a geo column thats called state that has maybe the you know lie and like the chords off stuff and then if you if you want to define that column as a state the number of users stays in the search bar sales by state company has been auto populate a geographical jordan scott from our truck for example and you can do that for zip codes can be as well so you know theaccount executive yeah client this is what i was talking about where if you want them to only see stuff one way and that way only you can set different things like that to where with if they search this or search that its going to pull up and the reason i showed you that isnt that at the beginning is up to say hey because sometimes in users they dont understand what is the best way to to tell this data right you know if it doesnt need to be in a line graph need to do stack column or were going to have it like that i was just showing you example of for you all as into how quick and easy it is to just kind of bounce through or if your executives are in you know say a presentation right data drill down account executive with the board and theyre like hey we want to see that like this growth whatever itll automatically you know they can do a line chart but i hope that kind of gives you that kind of the geo config and different you know discrepancies in here where you can actually set it to where you only want them to see what you want them to see does that make sense data drill down ends client and third party vendor does something similar you can designate a state as geographic and itll create a map or say its not and itll just show you a table with two letter codes or something like that yep yepaccount executive so youre youll have the same capability as far as controlling what they see and what they dont and how they see it data management  functions solutions engineer so yeah morning on you can i would say look at the jobs that are inside these worksheets so if you see here this worksheet is not all in one table but in fact we are having a bridge table here and multiple joins on top of fish this worksheet is sitting and you know the data samples is really you know the first number off how the data looks like and you can easily track the lineage of this you know which are the pin boards or answers are utilizing this worksheet data management  functions ends ,0.9919,0.12,0.0,0.88
low,won,company product,solutions engineer so thats a thats something i really liked because i want to understand you know the independence of this particular data object if you will so you get that option here so i just this is very useful so this is more for the end user so when a user users the worksheet called in sales you can give them kind of for like kind of like an instruction for stuff first off when they use it so they will have a guided workflow there company says hey please type sales first and then followed by region this is just to make sure they get comfortable with the search bar you can set up these lessons in our just more than that process a little bit more does it make sense and custom actions are kind of more advanced but you could basically like back data from company visualizations to elsewhere like third party vendor third party vendor back to third party vendor so you know these things are really what we call custom actions so far so so far we are we go down to watch itsolutions engineer yeah i personally am not a button that you know i like to be more api base so company has a lot of automation component the core part of that is what we called pml so every object and company on the back end has this pml which is simply at gamma fight onboarding process solutions engineer so you could use this to automate components in your workflow like dev test pride you know publishing one version reverting back to a previous version so all of these things make maintenance really easy you know when when you look at the big picture right so thats one more thing i like to point out,0.9928,0.172,0.01,0.817
low,won,demo,solutions engineer so let me actually show you one more thing on the light box that you know you might have not seen yet so we have another ai engine called name the whole purpose of the name is to find out trends anomalies correlations and against the data points that are available in the truck so then i hit name analyze what its gonna do this on the back end its gonna run a series of searches on the particular visualization and its gonna pilot only the top five or  insights that are things that have element right and usually the output office partake analysis as a brand new been more that has a valid if you have  hours so in this case i have some of my analysis that were done so if i click view results its going to showcase logic came up but so company as basically saying it found eight insights based on the dimensions and its gonna create a story out of each of those insights so in this case these  products you know account after the most change in that particular month so if this is useful i get up for that if its not i get the download it and basically tell company where it is going wrong or what does not relevant so this is supervise machine learning in action you know its learning based on user feedback so the next thing we run name its gonna probably be more in line with the expectation of what the user wants you know this is more the change analysis you can do like i said trend analysis and stuff like that but in this case i guess the user opted only for change and our system is this do you see how you can probably be benefited from something like this spot yeah this looks cool reallyclientclient,0.9559,0.077,0.013,0.91
low,won,wrap-up,account executive what what our thoughts i know we we we we only had an hour name ends account executive so we covered a ton of ground and theres a lot more to it but just out of curiosity right you know weve used third party vendor everyones im sure use kinds of other tools what are what are our thoughts on company i mean do you think this will be something that would be pretty beneficial for the organization i mean why do we like not like about it data management  functions client so how would you guys compare this compare to ask data im not sure if you guys are familiar with thatsolutions engineer yeah no no no its hr letting me but not i would really sit as data is just an addon right and it has its limitations like performance layer security wise data management  functions ends solutions engineer we weve tested it out and service plans would it be to see what our competitors are up to but that is not and then the three of the last name again i didnt do that one production instance blasted all over the third party vendor base so that dealt a lot of the information for you you can compare company which is a fullfledged search tool not just an addon so the the usage based banking all of those you know the name all of these are not you know you kind of compare that protested its very pretty much doing my opinion makes senseclientyeah i think its i think guest data is not quite asclient yeah we havent really explored that feature tosolutions engineer yeah but but i would encourage you toaccount executiveyeah like ask them the questions that just some of the basic questions that we asked there and and and you know in that system and and see what you know comes it comes about it i i think one of the one of the coolest things i mean it is you know the the live query time right not having to extract things in the third party vendor and being able to get you know accomplish what you all are trying to do instead of having to wait a couple of hours,0.9957,0.162,0.024,0.813
low,won,wrap-up,account executive i mean you know client i think you might have had a question or you know client client what are your thoughtsclient i have a couple of thoughts so i think a high level i think its pretty amazing at being able to answer some specific questions i think from a organizational point of view i think they use in in system one would really be limited to a subset of users that are more high level things search types client we havent we havent you know obviously you dont have a huge background on the different end users we have here but a lot of our users are managing traffic like like buying ads on removed facebook stuff in the granularity industry issues client and the amount of data they look at is usually really that gets really in depth like its not something that like i think a lot of these high level things would lend themselves well to answer a lot of questions but some of the day to day stuff as much more like we know we have reports that have you know  columns and you know   different maybe not  maybe five different dimensions and then  columns of metrics and they consume that data like that data drill down client so i dont know how they would use something like this as much i think theres a couple of you like i i know a couple of use cases right off the top of my head where this would be useful like you know like i had some exact say like you know revenue is down overall over the last few months in this one area you must have a different category mix what how do we look at that you know on yeah industry issues solutions engineerclient right so that kind of question can be easily answered by something like this but the more day to day where we have more like where we where where our team is focusing most of our efforts has been on the lower level larger amounts of granular datasolutions engineer yeah no that makes sense okayclientaccount executive,0.9952,0.172,0.023,0.805
low,won,company product, pricing solutions engineer credit but you know i think its just a its just a demo that we give us very high level like yeah lets stick into unknown they they look at merchandising data you know its like  columns wide data sets and they have they started off at  users and then today they have number users managed by two admins so they do it for the operational reporting like every day to day and the and the example that i might find very close to you also when youre talking to marketing data is thats a client we are working correctly that they also they have heat data the the analyst they use a traffic like the behavior of the consumer like which products are which web pages use cases solutions engineer did they move from one so they are analysts have pretty granular with very cool okay yeah thats thats actually client what you just said is thats our strong suit use cases ends account executive thats what company is for and we can what we can do i know this was very high level i just wanted to get an idea i can have many pull up or spin up a different instance and show you i could even if you wanted to get my marketing team involved and show you the hey look this is our data this is how we use we use company right because we actually data architecture solutions engineeraccount executive have spot apps right so we have removed marketing for ads we have facebook spot apps we have different things of that nature as long as that data that youre talking about is is going into third party vendor this is live guys you dont extract anything it its i mean its live queries it sits on top of company on top of third party vendor sorry so thats a great use case for company is we have a ton of data thats fine and weve gotta be extremely quick and figure out whats hitting whats not hitting should we do this should we not do this why is this performing why is this not thats a great use case for company,0.997,0.18,0.004,0.816

med,lost,small talk, hi client transcript we are constantly working to improve the quality of our english transcriptions as is the case throughout the industry its not as accurate as our english transcriptions  small talk  account executive client  hey good morning how are you im doing really since five am so i havent had a chance to do my hair im gonna stay off camera account executive  no problem i understand the world a zoom calls right client  yeah well i i also probably should tell you up front that if you havent read the news client as going through a massive restructuring which im leading them through but my time ends with them on august sixth gotcha  small talk ends  client  so this conversation is really kinda to inform me and educate me and give me what what the new scoop is for the next place i live account executive  gotcha okay interesting i actually i was poking around and doing some research im wondering why didnt see that yesterday when i was looking around client  yeah and thats what it was about six weeks or more ago and yeah they basically are getting selling off well shutting down part of their diagnostics business selling off another part and well well basically go from  people to about  and itll all be everythings gonna be valued on the innovation pipeline wow  working on the pipeline  small talk  account executive client account executive  yep i see it here client analysis  and an arbor  lay off yeah client  yeah wow yeah its deeper than that yeah account executive  okay wow im sorry to hear that client  yeah so my but i knew when i joined about a year and a half ago i knew it was a roll the dice yeah  small talk ends  account executive  yeah yeah what what are your thoughts for an extra client  well im gonna ive already got a lot of people hitting me up and ive had some conversations but im kinda taking my time ive got you know nine months of ramp so yeah ill wait for something really cool account executive  yeah for sure okay i appreciate the heads up if theres anything i can do to help you but client  i want to be a lot of socialaccount executive  analytics all the time so client  yeah yeah so so yeah its a its a its its the most prevalent topic in in i wanted to say it but probably in business today my mind account executive  yeah yeah you had mentioned in your linkedin notes that it was it was trending can i was gonna ask you what you meant by that was the trending in the industry or within more just what youve been reading about it client  i think it just in general all the conversations you know right nowadays whether it be at the business level or the the technology level thats the most prevalent topic right and everybody scrambling around to figure out how they can leverage their spend and and thai some roi to the investments theyre making around ai or analytics and and i think thats the struggle for a lot of companies right now  small talk  account executive  yeah for sure okay great well and i saw so i know youve been with name terror data so your your local here in city is that right client  yeah thats right i was actually born and raised here left when i was left in like  and came back in  account executive  okay where did you go in  client  area and wow area for a bit and all over the world lived in the medical in country yeah account executive  okay thats thats great where whereabouts are you in city okay client  you guys ataccount executive  were at my wife and i are in a one bedroom right now and by the way the way im trying to trying to find our way up to north county or somewhere near where her family lives around the scripts ranch area client  yeah account executive  but by in house right now is sort of a nightmare and its probably client  i wouldnt im telling you if you can wait and youve got a decent rental way unless youre pregnant and you need to and he did upsize account executive  right client  but yeah this is not the market to buy him account executive  yeah no thats for sure were hoping hoping it will cool down but even if it does cool down as our realtors are telling us theyre like hey were seeing its often in some parts but even if thats happening its gonna take a year client  man yeah i tell you i get almost daily i get a letter from somebody saying hey i really want to move into your area which are you considering selling your house on a cash buyer i mean its ridiculous account executive  yeah you account executive  guys are talking to real estate market here account executive  yes we are lamenting hey client  hows  it going account executive client account executive client  good you want to filler in or do you want me to filler and again account executive  yeah account executive  share something quickly here i dont think the real estate market its quite as hot in iowa right now thats where im calling from account executive  thats where i need to sort of look and shopping  small talk ends  client  account executive i was just explaining to name that this conversation is really gonna its i selfishly ticket for my own knowledge and i wanted to hear what you guys had to say and what was going on and and in in the industry what what changes are taking place what do you guys see but as far as any opportunity with client client he he he was just reading the announcement is six or eight seven weeks ago maybe even eight now now says massive read restructuring my time im im leading them through that restructuring as we eliminate the client diagnostics business and sell off the aveiro diagnostics business leaving the company that was almost  peoples down at about  or  and it should you know theyll operate and be valued on their innovation pipeline there will be no revenue generating business which means they dont get dont need me cant afford me and ill be my last day is august six with client so theres no opportunity with client but i will be moving on and so this can be preemptive conversation and and enlightenment for me to use for consideration whereveraccount executive  yeah thats thats great you havent heard about company were excited to share more account executive  yeah and and yeah client that was gonna be my next question have you heard of us before or had any client  well you know what i shouldnt say i havent at all the the the name stands out whether ive seen articles on linkedin or wherever i might have seen it i know i have its not completely foreign to me but i dont know details at all  data management  functions  account executive  gotcha okay as far as bi he goes i mean how how how much a part of bi tools or integration or visualization have you been a part of event whether it was tear data limit yeah client  you know terror data is very part of it although you know wasnt part of product development but neither here or there  data management  functions ends  client  i ran a bi tool there i ran a bi team at name at client the idea and the concept in my mind in the future state is not really bi i dont know what i would call that group but its bi ai its you know its much more of a progressive banking organization that is focused on leveraging data to enhance business operations so thats the way i look at it i think limiting it just to bi is probably a mistake account executive  yup fair enough okay so im not sure if you saw a couple of weeks ago our ceo publish something that was called dashboards are dead i dont know if that rings a bell at all client  it doesnt but ill tell you who i love that but im wondering though see thats the thing we only have  minutes so im gonna let you guys go ahead and maybe we can have a follow some of the time because ill dig into this and well get nowhere but thats funny that thats that i laugh at that because i think theyre past say too but finance finance leaders dont,0.9996,0.174,0.041,0.785
med,lost,about company, about company  account executive  right right yeah yeah and its all its all about how so we we look at it a little bit differently obviously than some of the folks in our industry if youre a third party vendor magic quadrant guy youll find us in the bi analytic space with third party vendor third party vendor click some of those that visualization dashboarding tools have today where we differentiate is about four seven of our founders came fromthird party vendor  search types  account executive  so they didnt come from that traditional bi analytics background they came here with the specific mission to provide athird party vendor like search experience and at the non technical business user so they can quickly search data and find answers to questions because what they said was is that basically where company begins is where the dashboard and if we have all these tools that are creating that and visualizations that are telling us one thing  industry issues  account executive  but four or five or six questions are stemming from that that dashboard doesnt answer the question so typically what we have to do is we have to go back to an it team or business analyst team or a bi team and say rework this dashboard to show me this this this and this and they say sure but its gonna say three two five business days right you prepared to wait that long to one of two things happens in the business use the wait that long to make decisions where they make decisions based on gut because they dont have the data in front of them  customer base  account executive  so ga name clients are really good example theyre one of our customers today they took all that name development discovery clinical global supply chain data all of their data their bottleneck was their commercial insights team an analyst or garage with business critical questions from business users on a daily basis  industry issues  account executive  and those questions were over and above what their dashboarding and visualization tools can handle or actually take care of at the present time and so what happened was there bi team and it an analyst or sitting there with a massivebacklog of requests for dashboard the data and on the other side or a bunch of business users who either dont have the data to make decisions  search types  account executive  so theyre waiting there or like i said before theyre making a decision based on guy so gsk implemented company which made all that data searchable and sort of have a real time format so users could search it find answers on their own and just a matter of seconds versus a matter of days or not at all previously for  industry issues  account executive  so so can you make that simpler for me client  hey are you saying that what what youre doing is youre providing a platform thats really selfservice and intuitive and easy enough for the business user to develop in mind whatever data they need for whatever report they need at that time  data architecture  account executive  a little bit of that yes so maybe itll be easier if i actually show you company an action to heres our user interface to your point before we are really that visualization layer so when we look at customers who have adopted something called a cloud data warehouse which you know really well third party vendor i think client is on third party vendor today is that right client  yeah you can say that loosely sure account executive  loosely okay so what weve done is weve partnered with customers who are moving data into the cloud data warehouse like third party vendors lake house is another one that we just partnered with those customers client  at allaccount executive  terror data we actually do we have an on premise connector to them to them the little backstory behind that we used to be an on premise appliance so what we would do is actually sell that hardware to customers and say okay lets move data into an in memory cash that we proprietary really cold falcon right and then wed say we can connect that in memory cash to something like a terror data or an ftp name and then actually hardest the search feed from that right but now that these technologies like third party vendor have come along weve pivoted to a saas model to say okay we can what we can offer this at a better cost and connect directly into platforms like third party vendor to harness their economic scale client  so is name data and not may are you not aware or is terror data and not making a significant strides in the in the saas space around vantage in in and warehouse in the cloud account executive  im not sure im not sure if they are client  probably account executive  know better client  play right now i just dont know how well theyre doing with it yeah  search types  account executive  yeah i mean thats thats an interesting question client  yeah okay anyway go ahead account executive  yeah no no problem so what were looking at here is actually like were looking at company as the user experience and think about consumer great analytics to its a really good way that we like to put it because when were thinking about okay what our founders said was why can i use the search bar in third party vendors all those personal applications that every business user uses in their personal lives why are we force to wrestle with a predefine rigid dashboard when we get to the corporate world,0.9988,0.144,0.028,0.829
med,lost,company product, pinboard  account executive  so why cant we rely on that samethird party vendor like search experience in business and analytics and so thats company so when were looking at the user interface here a lot of where customers and users of company like to start is actually at a pin board so we actually affectionately call dashboard pin boards one of our marketing execs came from pinterest so towards the play on words there and youll see this and sort of have in real time but really client what this looks like its kind of a combination of dashboards right but were not a better way to put it but when were looking at this view like i said before company starts where the dashboard and so this top  stores by sale is the dashboard right so thats all thats gonna tell me but when im in company i can actually interact with this live data thats in this pin board  data drill down  account executive  i can drill down into it with no limit to where i can go theres no sort of curiosity tax on the end user for what kind of data i can look at so i can go and look at product type within this pin board here and its all live data  data drill down ends  account executive  so i can go ahead and interact with it that way thats one way name to really get a guy folder client  round user based authentic our our access right account executive  yeah row level client  security but he gets to look at everythingaccount executive removed    removed exactly yeah so if youre we have about  percent of our customer base actually embed analytics into their platforms for customers  use cases  account executive  okay so they can say customer he can only see their data customer be he can only see their data et cetera et cetera yeah and basically what i was saying name uses us to actually drill down into the shelf level of data so what they look to company for is to say okay we have third party vendor or the visualization tool for that operational type maybe c level reporting and dashboarding  pinboard  account executive  they need to do what company allows them to do is actually drill down to the shelf level data to make inventory and pricing decisions on the fly so theyre interacting with that through a pin board so well go and show you another powerful piece of this which is actually searching on data  pinboard ends  client  so i see i see youre using thats more like a commercial dashboard does that do have plugins or does it integrate well with like sf dc and what what about einstein and account executive  yeah so we have that sort of that embedded portions we have customers that actually want to embed into name  data drill down  client  yeah account executive  or we have customers that are saying hey we want to pull our name data into something like third party vendor right and then create tables and company based on that data so its a little bit of both okay and so if were looking at this like if we were connected to name for example if i wanna look at something like failed last week by store i can just go ahead and type that into my search bar and outcomes to my visualization so the cool thing about this is when you looked at the search barremoved    removedyou can see my hands are often its doing a couple of things first one is search indexing so much like a regular third party vendor search helping me with okay based on time the last thing you search for once bottom five when i did the last demo or top three do you want to search for those again or do you wanna look at sales or quantity or product type its helping that business user along in the search versus those other tools where its okay yeah i dont know how to code sequel right to be able to go in there and create those visualizations so thats number one so i can go okay lets look at the top three because i actually want to boil this down further,0.9984,0.156,0.017,0.827
med,lost,company product, pinboard  account executive  this is interesting it might be something i wanna say for a oneonone with the boss or maybe its customer data want to show a customer my next meeting with them im actually gonna pin this to my pin board will create client pin board here type ad that visualization so we can come back to it later  pinboard ends ,0.6249,0.097,0.0,0.903
med,lost,customer base,account executive  so and i know were probably on the line of talking about client versus future state but with this happening at client today or how does somebody get to this level of granularity client  god its its the way you you its the way you outlined upfront that traditionally is done by image or organizations  industry issues  client  we have bi team that scrambling around most of their day is taken change in dashboards that have already been created because is additional demand or there theres missing data or whatever it is so it was you know building that out and third party vendor and you know it was it was highly inefficient and and exactly the way you described it upfront account executive  yeah okay and i would imagine there are probably squeaky wheels in your organization is what we client  thats thats the thing right its a matter of demand they had an i mean the team had a long queue of of of demand and and its its whoever screamingremoved    removedallowed us and usually finance when  customer base  client  so my whole bi team although we had plans and maturing it was mostly dedicated to finance and not doing much with commercial or for commercial account executive  okay interesting thats what we find that sort of of account executive  rejected client  client has never been more than just a startup right so its a bright but i think thats a big opportunity for for a company like yours is in that small growing organization,0.9768,0.136,0.044,0.82
med,lost,about company,account executive  yeah i think its a little bit of both to i mean weve especially as we pivoted to a fast model last  months or so like my my team is named at the small medium sized business for sure work with a lot of startups who are especially embedding analytics and applications to make it interactive data experience for their eventual users client  yeah client i didnt mean to suggest you guys werent prepared to support large enterprise account executive  yeah client  that is the value for the value in smaller growing companies is higher because they can do it upfront and they can they can build it for scale right account executive  for sure for sure yeahremoved    removed about company ends  account executive  and thats a good point i would imagine at terror data and name its probably at a larger scale right but its probably okay we have the third party vendor visualizations or maybe third party vendor from an enterprise agreement or some sort of of yeah exactly okay so a couple of other things ill show you here,0.9706,0.188,0.044,0.768

med,lost,about company,account executive  and i just dont have time to do it right what the motivation to do it client  pardon have to do it and theres probably be on that shouldnt say smart enough youre probably skilled enough to do it but your general use desktop to you want if you about a service for the business where they can get get gain value and reduce the amount if you dont want your your finance people your commercial people having to you know do a bunch of coding to to get the data they need and you dont want to build a massive team to support so you want something intuitive and thats why i mentioned earlier how much of this is kind of selfservice right and is that one of your principles when youre developing as an organization or account executive  yeah yeah exactly so well just gonna say for example client  heyclient is that one of your principles for company as youre developing this platform to make it as intuitive and selfservice as possible is that kind account executive  thats exactly where were going yeah so as we continue to develop it and even i can talk about the last  month because thats when we started to pivot to a saasremoved    removedmodel a little bit more we have one of our capabilities is company everywhere which is our developer version where they embed analytics into applications for their consumers and thats really turned into a developers play around and so were trying to make it as simple as possible not only from a user experience and self service perspective but also from a development perspective for those engineering and product teams to be able to client  thats the thats the exciting part for me when i look at something like this is because i probably characterize myself as is is one of the more business focused ceos that i know anyway and so when i look at something like this and it helps when im thinking about what i think it should be or i think what a bi team should be doing or lets call it a data science team because its more than just bi does that i want to hand tools to the the business to allow them for lack of better terms you know give them that gives them a sandbox to play in right where they can do what they need to do for themselves versus investing in a massive team that has to take demand from the business and build it right and then i can invest in you know other skill sets around data science  industry issues  account executive  yeah exactly we started as the message was lets not have our analysts the report jockeys client  yeah account executive  she was all day long yeah exactly its evolved its evolved to be have that and then half lets let our developers who is the buyer build mentality but thats what our developers have that play around to build something like this into the application so that they can speed up their development time and and not have to make something like this to my take two or three years right  about company  client  how long how long is this product been out account executive  we as a company has been around for about removed years  twelfthclient removed    removed okay so account executive  you started really more than that enterprise space so i probably would have heard us more around our customers like for eyes and ci bc name one that we town  data architecture  account executive  but now that weve come into from a management perspective especially the saas models just we can centrally manage manage everything and now that we can connect to something like a third party vendors harnessed their power to get search speed like this now we can move really quickly  customer base  account executive  and so for the set from a saas model perspective like i said were building out smaller commercial teams sort of its been exciting rich and trying to run towards the city stock exchange you know and so what that entails is bringing on smaller companies that are going to grow with us,0.9986,0.15,0.008,0.842

med,lost,about company, about company  account executive  so we are recording this conversation as well if if anyone wants to view it for future reference so just to give you a high level overview of who company is right start products been on the market since removed so about removed years old and you know if youre looking at the analytics market youre probably familiar it sounds like with third party vendor theres also quick theres also third party vendor number of analytics tools out there what makes company different is search and ai that is the core of our product and that is what differentiates us from these other analytics products out there and thats why weve been able to mass over about removed  at this point many of the logos what you will see here so we have big and small customers it ranges from the gambit and weve also earn just some industry recognition we were a leader in the third party vendor magic quadrant in the bi space we have a number of strategic partnerships that youll see here with third party vendor with a ws with removed so its been a its been a very exciting run over the the past seven years so when you think of company as a product wives our product you can exist right and it all comes down to productivity insights to actions so its a little bit of a backstoryremoved    pm removed our founders came from some of these main stream you know consumer at companies likethird party vendor  and they had first hand experience with how these apps or revolutionizing how consumers were interacting with data in there life and they saw this huge pain point in the in the enterprise space right  industry issues  account executive  they saw a huge pain point with companies being able to consume analytics quickly and when they looked into that it really boils down to analytics is a very technical process and you have to be very technical in nature to be able to build a report or dashboard to query the database to model that into distribute that dashboard right  search types  account executive  and with the explosion of data and the speed of this personalized customer experience that our customers now expect being able to only access analytics if your technical just doesnt cut it so they wanted to come in at the market through away that were all used to interacting with data everyday life to democratize data for all companies so were doing that through how were used to interacting with data in their everyday life and thats through search right so through search youre able to now search on your enterprise data so you can go and you can type in showing my top performing stores across the us right and then company will automatically populate a visualization for you and again its all about speed insights so whether your technical or not whether youre in marketing whether youre an analytics what are your database architect whether youre in finance you can go and you can ask a question from your data and get your answer on the spot in a very simple smart fast way before we move over to the demo  use cases  account executive  i just wanted to quickly talk about a customer removed is one of our one of our big customers in your space there you know a little bit bigger when it looks at like revenue size and stores but very applicable to what you may be looking to do now just reading up on client so theyre using us across their supply chain lets get quick insights no to their inventory shipping invoices and things of that nature theyre using us on the legal side for spm nights look at restaurant financials and also restaurant development right so theyre new store development where are they gonna put these the cost of construction things of that nature about company  account executive removed    pm removed  so ill send out a follow up just a short video that you did for us just talking about how with company with being able to have a familiar way to interact with data they save a ton of time were able to get insights much much quicker client account executive i dont know if you can disclose but i know chick fillet is also a third party vendor customer so can you maybe explain to the group like how do they how they blend the two platforms together like you know who on the business teams are using company you know versus versus third party vendor how do they make that decision account executive  yeah thats a great question so the interesting thing over the past few years has been like some of some of our biggest customers like chick fillet name rising and also based on what third party vendor is biggest customers and that comes down to a shift from a dashboarding model to a self a true selfservice model so where we see company really really shine is one freeing up the the analytics folks to be able to to not have to respond to all the dashboard request so they can focus on things to to move the needle  industry issues  account executive  so thats where youll see this you know  hours of productivity also to the business folks who dont have to wait for a third party vendor dashboard anymore and they can just come to company ask a question and get an answer on the spine and not just ask one question but ask two three four or five more questions right after that so thats really where the supply chain i notice the marketing folks the finance folks really find a lot of value with being able to get very granular on the spot without having to see an answer or visualization and ask the dashboard team to get them a new dashboard they can just ask the next question right there on the spot does that answer the question client yep it helps me understand the distinction and and are the dashboards that are the selfservice dashboard or are they being prepared by analyst and then just consumed by business users or is there are still some some technical aptitude needed to get those dashboard or at least the certified data sources you know set up in order for for company to consume it,0.9971,0.085,0.011,0.905
med,lost,demo, agenda  account executive  its a great question i think i think the demo which answer that question really really well just to show you so let me stop sharing now be a great segue into the demos to name im gonna pass it over to you to to get us startedremoved    pm removed  okay  great client sales engineer  search types  sales engineer  so everyone see my homepage here yep okay so as i go through it please feel free to ask questions well walkthrough that capability so user but down go into the back end how do we get here some of my data is really a business to consumer more marketing and campaign effectiveness it is for streaming video service some of that data just some of the background but one of the things youre gonna see is you know as a user coming into company and able to do a lot of the things i do in the data lives i see what what am i looked at recently  pinboard  sales engineer  maybe focus on some of those key metrics across the top but they can also see whats trending in the organization so i can see these trending answers and trending pin boards and answers or just that their answers to that question users already passed and then a pin board is a collection of answers that a business user simply pinned to a page and so instead of having to have that analyst or developer building a batch board the pin boards or user driven just like if i went into pinterest i saw so that like i want to pin that view so thats why i would call them pin boards instead of dashboards as a user i can actually search for my answer multiple ways i can actually search for existing answers and i can also search the raw data to build a new answer so im actually gonna start with that search and so so i may want to say well show me my conversions by campaign and simply typing that into my search bar im now gonna look at all of those answered by the way im in this toggle right now to search answers i can then get all of these different answers that may have already been asked by my peers bubbled up if i highlight some of these for example this conversion by campaign content its not the individual campaign but its actually the type of content that were actually grouping those campaigns in but i do see that were leveraging the metrics of conversions as i scroll down i may actually see this page here you know so ive got multiple visualizations this was a pin board that someone is created and now i can actually see what are those frequent metrics in the group things that were looking at and you see that conversions the costs lifetime value by the way were also grouping this by the view so this may be of interest for me to investigate that a little bit further so now were bringing up this particular pin board that someone else has already created by did my global search of this data and now i can see this conversions by h group content total impressions see some of these viewsremoved    pm removed  industry issues  sales engineer  as a user we have the ability to drill down and drill anywhere and ill do this a little bit later so we can ask more questions of this data but the real power company is how did actually build some of this content its not a developer its not you know it  data drill down  sales engineer  its a user simply asking a question and so lets go ahead and ask a question or our data and lets say i wanna look at that click through rate percentage and lets look at this by campaign the actual campaign name and well go ahead and run that quick query  data drill down ends  sales engineer  and there is my click through rate percentage by the campaign name sorry just a little bit of a delay here my bremoveder client  yeah quick question im trying to find that hand raising thing but but where is this im the marketing person so im just wondering where where are you getting the campaign and like media information data is that coming from like sales engineer  you mean where where does this data actually come from client  right right sales engineer  okay so a couple of things so now ill go into this a little bit later but what am i actually searching on is what we call a worksheet okay and a worksheet is that business view for that search data architecture  sales engineer removed    pm removed  so ive got campaign name i got the click through rate percentage which may actually be a calculation no so im looking at impressions and clicks here now the data itself were actually connected live in this case to a third party vendor database so thats by cloud data warehouse we can connect to those cloud data warehouses how you get that data into those environments could be from a variety of different methods there but theres you know many times connectors and different data transformation stores thats not something that company does we sit on top of your data where it exists client  okay so we wouldnt have had to use like connectors and basically send our marketing data from like third party vendor for example like cost data for example to third party vendor in order to populate this view sales engineer  thats correct and then we would just sit right on top of that analytical warehouse and third party vendor and then provide the search experience client  okay thank you sales engineer  yep so here i did a quick search a click through rate percentage by campaign name they gave me a quick answer a lot of details  search types  sales engineer  well maybe i want to focus this on that campaign content and you notice before i even started typing were actually bubbling up suggestions for the user this is based on machine learning looking at my past searches as well as my peers here so if i wanna look at this like campaign content  data drill down  sales engineer  and by the way lets just focus on the top  so here were leveraging one of our key words of that top and the focus on just the top  campaigns and now were also coloring this by what is the campaign name so is it something around maybe burgers or the check in or something like that within your stores that may be your campaign content or food type that were filtering this data yeah all the while while the users asking these questions we will give you a breakdown of what were actually doing so were competing that click through rate percentage for eachremoved    pm removed campaign name for every content and then were also ranking this by that click through rate percentage and picking that top  here  pinboard  sales engineer  so this is actually creating that structure query automatically for the user now if i want to then save this for later or share it with others its as simple as coming into this pin and let me go ahead already have one no i dont have one for myself so ill create daves pin board so im gonna go ahead and add my own personal pin board there and now ive got the beginnings of that sort of dashboard view of our data now anywhere along the way if i want to come in and modify my search we can do that  data drill down  sales engineer  so if i to look at this lets go ahead and get rid of that individual campaign name the top  and let me look at this now daily and im gonna just add another search now we have a field called date and im gonna break this down on a daily basis we can do weekly monthly year over year type analysis but now i can see that click through rate percentage for campaign content on a daily basis and maybe i only want to focus on the last nine months worth of data so simple again keyword the last and were doing the last nine months of data based on todays date  pinboard  sales engineer  so this is how easy it is for the user to simply ask a question modify,0.9992,0.117,0.015,0.868
med,lost,demo,removed    pm removed account executive  then the idea is that you know all of the end users like marketing f piano whoever it may be can then just build off of that foundation and get more and more insights without having to necessarily rely you know on the technical team to to build more dashboards for them moving forward  search types  account executive  so thats where were thats where were seeing just a lot of the value back to you know the checkpoint question thats what they saw a lot of the value is just being able to deliver you know easy to use platform like this you know to drive selfservice insights company we just get the insights on the spot and take action when they need it  data drill down  sales engineer  and while were here back to you yeah did did want to point out you know with this visualization right now we have an automatic charge suggestion where were given a best practice visualization but as a user you can also come in and you can change the visualization that youre leveraging you can toggle between the actual ad data in the chart view here  data drill down ends  sales engineer  so i can see that table view we could download that of course now one of the things that company does as well in addition to this auto suggestion of hey heres some search firms is the ability that augment what you as an analyst or business units are doing  data drill down  sales engineer  so for example if i wanna see my conversions on a monthly basis and lets go ahead and run a quick search on that toggle over to our chart view here i can see my conversions on a monthly basis well you know one of the things i see here is for example this spike between february and march,0.9473,0.07,0.0,0.93
med,lost,company product,sales engineer removed    pm removed  we had a change in conversions as a user i could come in i could drill anywhere into our data it says drill down i can drill into any of these attributes but i may not know exactly what was the root cause for this change so i want to know what are those drivers and so what we can do is leverage what we call company product analyze and company product analyze will allow me to select what are these attributes that we want to focus in on and company now will automatically do those drills into all those different attributes and if we find a significant a contributor to that change we will bubble that up in a search automatically for the user so if i come in to our view now i ran that same one earlier you can see that actually running this right now its just taking a few seconds to run that so just go problem actually it already finished so were looking at that conversion increase from the nine point  to  point three between those two dates and we found these insights so i can actually see where those change and conversions by county because that was one of the attributes you can see the biggest change that conversions state so maybe we had some sort of campaign that was focused in state or maybe it was a nationwide campaign that just did really well in state in this case also see the conversions so here i can see the actual campaign name that we had the biggest increase so this is a great way for a user to leverage company augmented intelligence to help them analyze the data now if i want i can just simply again pin this to my own pin board we can give it a thumbs up or thumbs down to provide feedback but what weve essentially done if i come in and edit this as we ran that search automatically for the user and so this is just showing that search where were comparing that march versus february we have formulas where were calculating the change between those two dates as well as percent change and then bringing in the different attributes and setting a filter based on that formula which instances saying well if at percent change met a certain threshold so again ill pause here are there any questions on this  data architecture  client  i have another question its i dont think it relates to this exactly but as far as the back end and setting it up to connect with third party vendor what is whats the average ramp up time and how like how hard is it to get all those worksheets or those data sources integrated with this tool sales engineer  yeah so many times what well do as a proof of technology is well do what we call a zero to search workshop so if you already have data in third party vendor we can actually connect and be searching that data within a matter of  to  minutes so the ability to come in if i come in or since it going into connection i choose my data source that were connecting to put it in our credentials and then select most tables and i can begin searching almost immediately the zero in the search workshop data architecture ends  sales engineer removed    pm removed  then well focus on that worksheet of saying hey do i need to maybe modify the names of the fields that we need that add some different measurements are formulas to bring that in as well as adding those sentiments so up and running very quickly on those data sources what we typically see from my production roll out as we kind of start with what are the types of questions that you want to ask and work backwards from those types of questions to okay what is the day that needed to be able to resolve that and then what are those metrics that we need to build out from there so many times your customers will have that already had company up and running may have a brand new use case up and running within you know a weeks time frame okay client  and as far as users getting access is that connected is that able to connect until like using a d or is it how do you manage user access i guess  pinboard  sales engineer  yeah absolutely so a couple of things from a security client  implement let me sales engineer  go ahead im just redesigning this pin board that we created earlier so we integrate with your existing authentication methods so we can authenticate the users coming in we can also provide a role based access so you know for example this pin board i can come in i can share this content with maybe my peer fill bayless  pinboard ends  sales engineer  we can also youll make sure that they have access to that underneath line worksheet as well once ive got access to the search experience and to pin boards when each users and we can also apply row level security meeting im only gonna see in this case maybe the campaigns im responsible for maybe its my region or maybe its my individual restaurant that we would look at so you can provide data level security authentication here as well ,0.9986,0.124,0.01,0.866

med,lost,company product,sales engineer  yeah so the the search that were looking at could be down to as granular as the data that youve got stored within your cloud data warehouse so if you want to go to the individual device id as long as you have that data available i could actually type in that particular id or that particular date so we can go down to that granular level of detail  data drill down ends  client  got it account executive  for example client like im sorry client  it can it can client surface whatever in the data warehouse so as long client  its like inthird party vendor data studio and not right nope like it wouldnt be able to pick an update as to yes i think the question right exactly yeah  pinboard  sales engineer  and so what is happening is once ive sent that query to that data source we send the results back and thats our bi visualization server says hey heres the best practice chart or graph of course a user can modify that and then were you know adding those as saved answers or pin boards,0.9704,0.127,0.006,0.866
med,lost,about company,sales engineer  we can also embed this into other applications we have a mobile device so if you want to consume this information via your mobile device as well you can do thatremoved    pm removed sales engineer  other questions on this and by the way i know that we have a couple of different user communities  use cases  sales engineer  i just happened to pick youre doing some of the more marketing campaign effectiveness client really is looking at some of that consumer experience with your apps and i understand youre opening up a drive through soon so im looking at you know that that kind of data here account executive  thing its just an addition to the digital space which i would say our top two use cases that we will see out there like digital is obviously one of them like customer experience from an omnichannel perspective is a huge use case because obviously theres so many different ways you want to slice and dice to understand the customer experience and you know whats leading the customer to fulfilling are converting or whats causing a customer to drop off in the experience so thats a huge use case for us but is also equally one of our one of our most popular use cases that we see here came at  degree view of the business and driving those insights across  about company  account executive  no for the whole company you know i know i know prizes a different industry big fortune  company but like the cna business analytics team like its company and their whole company for any sort of financial data about you know what devices theyre selling what promotions theyre running what customers are churning anything of that nature theyre all coming to company to be able to get selfservice analytics for that so two great use cases that were seeing in the industry account executive  any other questions that any other questions any other you know you know client value proposition like if were you know if were trying to compare this first third party vendor then how are we really positioning company about company ends  clientremoved    pm removed  you know against well i dont wanna say against third party vendor but you know proposing this as a potential alternative or supplemental solution you know leaderships gonna want to know so how is that why do you need this and how what kind of insights what kind of value are we going to get out of this that we cant get out of third party vendor  use cases  account executive  definitely speed insights is you know probably with the cornerstone of the value prop and then start thinking you know dependent on if its a digital use case or finance use case but well take digital in this standpoint you know what would happen if you were able to get the answer or the insights to your customer whos falling off the website on the spot,0.9957,0.131,0.012,0.857
med,lost,about company, use cases ends  account executive  then you can return send them a push notification on the app that theyre on or shoot them a promotion email or something of the like to get them to convert instead of falling off just having that speed to insight on the spot instead of having to maybe wait  industry issues  account executive  im not i dont know if this is the actual state of the business actually check but if you do have to wait for dashboard to be built to be able to get those insights thats where we see a lot of the value its okay youre youre waiting week maybe two weeks to get these dashboards and get these insights  use cases  account executive  what would happen if you were able to just get them on the spot and then take action and engage your customer or be able to engage your supplier you know to negotiate more you know lucrative inventory costs for your for your supply chain or something of that nature so thats the foundation of the value prop that weve seen that our customers build from there you know call center use cases it costs a lot of customers you know  to  dollars every time a customer calls in what if you could have speed to insight to understand okay this person just had you know their network just dropped lets reach out to them instead of them calling into our call center lets solve their problem and that saves us you know millions of dollars over the year so things of that and thats where we see the value propremoved    pm removed  use cases ends  client right so for my business friends out there i think if were considering how we use third party vendor today i think one of the hurdles is its not really the fact that you know third party vendor isnt doing it doesnt have the capability to do what we wanted to do its more of that in order for us to get something out that are at an enterprise level that meets you know our standards and all that stuff  search types  client it takes time and the ability thats company has is it can rapidly prototype and produce insights because it has a visualization layer thats driven by search based algorithms and not really focused on like point and click type information and filtering and visualizations like that its smarter than third party vendor and it uses search in order to remove some of the dependencies of creating you know table based joins and and things like that is is my you know high level i guess read on this,0.9936,0.122,0.02,0.858
med,lost,about company,sales engineer  yeah client again if we dont have the data in third party vendor or any other source and its not gonna help that problem its not gonna help us get data faster  data management  functions  client you know we still have to source data and get it into a warehouse in order for it to become consumable by company so that doesnt its not eating that processremoved    pm removed but it is i think eating the ability for us to draw insights and analysis from the sales engineer  yeah  industry issues  sales engineer  one of my other cost or not my customers but company customer was also finding they had a lot of great third party vendor dashboards but they started doing inventory they have thousands of third party vendor dashboard and their usage of those the majority of them were never used meaning they had these request hey can you answer this question  pinboard  sales engineer  someone would have to go build a dashboard and then that dashboard never was used again they had their core of hey these are your mission cool dashboards that they care but then those sort of of add hot questions they said thats all going to company now removed did an analysis of pin board views in company for a week and i had roughly  a pin board views but they had  add hot questions answered,0.9778,0.117,0.02,0.863
med,lost,customer base,sales engineer  and i look at those  questions as as hey did we need to build a dashboard for that probably not we just need the answer that quick question and deliver that for them client yeah and and third party vendor dashboards often get stale very quickly so unless youre constantly updating enhancing and maintaining that dashboard and youre adding new capabilities and functionality to it you know there youre probably missing out on a lot of add hawk or more granular business driven request that cant be met unless the dashboard is is updated and that usually requires my team if its an enterprise dashboard which i think is you know one of the benefits here is that were putting the power of of the analytics creation in the hands of the business user once a template has been client  and where i kind of saw some value as well as a lot of times when we build these enterprise dashboards recollecting requirements across acrossremoved    pm removed departments  industry issues ends  client  and so a lot of times have you its not the exact view to answer the exact question that one person needs on for in on the up and  versus somebody on the marketing team i think i where i see the value in something like this is for example client i think we talked like last week about wanting to see a slice of shack by order mode by forgot what the last little piece was it  industry issues  client  if we just didnt have that kind of slice on a dashboard but something like this could be a place where those add hot questions and well be easily shared with say the arm m or something like that client  yeah i think i mean that would certainly help and making the teams a little bit more self sufficient and being able to like you know make your own dashboard or pin or whatever it is  agenda ,0.9879,0.128,0.005,0.868
med,lost,next steps,client okay does anyone have any other questions you know we can regroup internally and see if theres any other follow ups that we may have but account executive or name anything you wanna add that we probably havent mentioned yet client  quick one so yeah going back yes i got a little bit to the operators i think thats what he said they use it for everything or just inventory,0.8316,0.119,0.0,0.881
med,lost,company product,account executive  operators that name so theyre using the client  mobile or mobileremoved    pm removed account executive  so like yes the the the the use cases are like supply chain that pmt team they are using it for you know insights into their restaurants ventures and account balances and then theyre also doing like their supply chain team is just constantly analyzing their inventory and the inventory needed for their stores to to make sure that theyre optimizing their supply chains and getting product where it needs to be does that answer your question client  yeah i was wondering if it was like just them using that inventory if theyre doing it like payroll inside sales inside there its just account executive  yeah theyre definitely looking at sales insights as well id have to double check on the payroll insights but sales insights package  use cases ends  client  theyre looking at account executive  that theyre actually or six pages did they just expanded with us as well in their finance organization theyre going to be bringing in no lot more data so ill double check on the payroll insights to see if thats there too client  that brings up a question in my head so dirty shut up operators so is there a way to and data im sorry if you said so but is there a way to say a permission users based on their role to only see certain data so for example a gm at one check and only see that gyms data or something like that sales engineer  yeah absolutely so theres two different ways of sharing the content so first of all when i share the worksheet i can determine which line of business or which group gets access to that search experience so i may have that business to consumer worksheet and that may have spm a worksheet that are just shared with those individual groups now once i have the ability to search on that worksheet we can set role level security meeting im gonna filter the data maybe its a store or the reach and so that user has the same search experiences everyone that has access to the worksheet but their data is going to be filtered based on your own title,0.9805,0.127,0.036,0.837

med,lost,agenda,client  the add the products and the customization that you could like be able to have it match are you x theres some other embed ubl solutions it kinda seemed like maybe you could change some colors but like we we wouldnt really be able to get a match our low to match your look and feel thats pretty boring you mainly curious to see sort of what the options are for embedding it and customizing it and then id love to just hear the sort of secondary any examples you have like similar use cases to us so a company that wanted to embed something for their own customers to you sort of at the scale that we would be doing so account executive  good company employee  cool yeah and client ill im ive got an application that weve embedded company inside of so i can walk you through that and its got youll youll start to get a feel for what what it looks like and so what will walk you through that and then we can also show you a little bit about how you theres a developer playground where you go in and you can test these types of things out i can i can walk you through that too client  hello thing if we can touch on also is around like the localization i think i think we touched on this in the last call but like thats one of our you know challenges weve seen with with embedding is we we generally like the way our solution works today is we have basically a dictionary of terms and in australia you know the the term is slightly different than what it is and us are completely different but in our data model we dynamically render the names of the data sets the columns to reflect the clients terminology based on the geography so like all australian clients see certain terms in certain ways whereas if youre in the uk it looks different because maybe the concept doesnt that word doesnt even make sense there so we dynamically on you know on the fly we swap those terms out so id like to i guess talk about how that like put that on the agenda also if we could,0.996,0.172,0.022,0.806
med,lost,customer base,account executive  yeah quick question about that client is that something that you guys have set up in name or whatever data models fueling your current applications im just curious where the different client  no the the the underlying data store like is static and its just in english and with our kind of us base dictionary and you know whatever we originally call it but theres basically a translation layer that sits on top of it and when things are being rendered in the user interface terms can be swapped out  data architecture  account executive  okay interesting thanks company employee  remind me client what is the data storage layer thats just in the us locale client  its its the same across all geography is its the exact same data store across geographies so you know its either post grass or potentially third party vendor but theyre just you know  small talk ,0.9509,0.125,0.01,0.865
med,lost,small talk,company employee  hey im pretty good sorry for being late no worries i suppose we account executive are we waiting for anyone else i know client youve got to drop account executive  yeah this is this is the group so were good to kick us off company employee  okay perfect so let me hold on let me share my screen real quick and  small talk ends  company employee,0.891,0.231,0.102,0.667
med,lost,demo,company employee  okay can you all see my screen okay company employee  all right so what what ill do here and client this is i think in line with with what you were saying ill start in an application that weve built an embedded company inside of and kind of walk you through what that looks like obviously ask questions and what once weve done that ill ill get into a little bit about how you do this how you embed something and then we can we can get into some of the other topics client and i know youve gotta jump so maybe well do well do a time check maybe  minutes for you have to leave and then we can jump back into the embedding if we want to if if we want to get into the localization conversation okay so as a user client  i company employee  would log into my application and just just to sort of point something out here this this application its eight marketing this is our app its fake its a fake company obviously so whatever youre looking at here theres nothing company at this point like this is just the application the parent application so this would be yours is sort of the this would be your application ive got the ability when im walking through this to sort of toggle through personas obviously in your scenario there would be some sort of sso or some sort of trusted authentication or something so that youre not toggling you are who you are right so like if you log in is camilla like you cant decide that you want to be nancy for example right im just this gives me the ability to toggle back and forth so if i were to start out as camilla and sort of walk you through some capabilities i might land on a page like this again nothing here company you know you would have your menus your controls all of that sort of stuff whatever makes sense for your app and then you could start to look at different components of company and so weve got a couple of different ways to embed we have a visual embed sdk where you could take different components of content from company such as a live boards or answers or search bar all that sort of stuff and you could bed embed them inside of your app and as part of that as ill show you here in a bit you you can sort of remove privileges and things of that nature that you might not do when youre just looking at company standalone  pinboard  company employee  and so for instance ive gone to this campaign performance page that name has access to this is a live board or what we formerly called the pin board thats been loaded up hereremoved    removed  pinboard ends  company employee  this is something where you know she has no access to a lot of the navigation features that you would normally have in company so those things have been hidden right probably obvious to point that out but just wanna make sure youre aware theres a lot of different levels of sort of hiding of things that that you can do here  pinboard  company employee  now whats interesting is you know you come into something like this and and again im probably stating the obvious here but all of the core company capabilities are are just there and and and again you can turn these things off but you know like going in and exploring within a pin board and starting to filter and the developer doesnt need to do anything extra to make this stuff work it just works right so if you want your users to be able to toggle through and receive suggestions and you know replace content maybe replace campaign with the gender for example right like folks are going in and doing this and slicing and dicing without the developer doing anything it just does it because its of course part of the product okay so embedding live forwards or pin boards as we formerly called them very easy to do you know doing things like embedding a search bar where a user could actually go in and you know more gosh you know let me look at my conversions by campaign for example you know if theyre going in and asking an answering their own questions and what youll notice here is again this is the search experience weve removed the ability for the user to save this so just going again into your ability to control that fine grained level capabilities like i cant go pin this to a pin board a lot of things that i cant do all i can do is look at the underlying data  pinboard ends  company employee  i cant save i cant download so those are things you can remove as as part of your choices when when you embed this but again if you wanted them to save you know thats up to you as well client  hi guys there when you embed our our all of these parts just come together im wondering if theres if theres a use case where you just embed the search bar any works with our current reporting in some waycompany employee removed    removed  when you say works with your current reporting can you expand on that a little bit i wanna make sure i understand where youre coming from with that client  i think where i come from is better because im not and maybe name you cant you could expand if you understand what im saying im trying to figure out hey we were going to do something like this how do we not how do we leverage all the work that weve been doing modeling our data building our ui for creating reports we dont really have this conversation so got it and that will be that will be something that we would like the visualizations as well  data management  functions  client  but its more about the data modeling and theyre reporting kind of ui dragging and dropping fields and creating these reports company employee  okay so we would leverage so youve built the data model we would just leverage we would be pointing to the same data model so company would you know if youve got third party vendor reports for example pointing to a data model company would point to that same data model be able to query the same tables and so on obviously you know each like we have our own met a data or semantic layer just like third party vendor and other tools do so youre gonna do some creation and company that you know to define things and company terminology but we would point to the same data and so you wouldnt have to redo anything there if that makes sense  data management  functions ends  client  yeah i mean it does that generally so thanks for that company employee  yep and and you know the other thing id say is i dont even know if i have any examples here like if you guys yeah so youll notice if i hover over like this is our semantic layer im exposing in this we got a web marketing worksheets to business layer right if i hover over things youll see tool tips for example that give information about the data you can also put other stuff in here like descriptions and so if youve got a catalog were youve got that type of information theyre api is that you can use to go pull that sort of met a data into company so youre not manually recreating all of that so thats an option as well depending on what what what youve got there and your layerclient removed    removed  yeah what weve done is like we created our own api too so we have this data model and then create an api to pull into reporting  data management  functions  client  and ideally we could just like leverage the same api since weve already built it and it you know understand the what we built was a data model for financial information and its a incredibly complex data model just because a lot of different financial tools that have very complicated relationships to one another  data management  functions ends  client  and so obviously wed want to be able to leverage that works is it took a ton of time to do all that and im sort of thing what how yeah how this could work with that company employee  yeah i mean so if youve got a like we can query complex data models we do really well at at one thing i would say that you might that just might be something to think through if if if a as as youre planning this out and then one of the things thats fundamental the company is this idea that you can be very interactive with the data  industry issues  ,0.9993,0.116,0.014,0.87
med,lost,company product,company employee  and so as opposed to more of the reporting paradigm where the report will go run and it will render and then people will do something with people are going to be doing things like drilling and exploring and all that sort of stuff so you know the the reason that i mentioned that is they have less of a tolerance for like slow reports you know like a report is what a report is right  data management  functions  company employee  but when youre interacting people sort of want it to be faster and so a complex data model all things being equal youll just want to think through hey do we want to build maybe a dimensional layer that sort of services are interactive queries that kind of sits on top of that complex layer dont have to data management  functions ends  removed    removed company employee  but if youre thinking about it from a user experience standpoint that might benefit you in the long run that makes sense okay so account executive  i guess my god can i just ask a question for yeah the reporting the financial reporting youre talking about right now is there much of an interactive layer that is these are built out already or that you would like to build out and just curious i mean if youre talking financials i know a lot of people will just export to excel and thats thats what they know and thats how they boys works but but whats the experience right now and and for these specific reports i mean how much interactivity do you want the customer to have client  i think again it depends on the user but for like the most sort of of the user the most permission it would be quite a bit like right now they can basically build a report and access any of their companies financial information so itll be similar to that where like they already have access to all that information,0.9888,0.129,0.0,0.871
med,lost,small talk,company employee  so theres theres definitely some add hawk and some sharing there that would be beneficial it sounds like if there if if im understanding you right kit account executive  yeah client  yeah foraccount executive removed    removed  sure company employee  yeah okay okay brac i cut i cut you off there go ahead account executive  no no that was helpful im just trying to wrap my head around this example but yeah think it company employee  yeah i mean i think that and we talked a little bit about this last time if youve got use cases where yeah and these folks you know theyre getting the reports but then they have all these questions that were having trouble keeping up with or wed rather not keep up with thats where you sort of build you know this layer benefits you greatly there right so client  okay any questions company employee  i mean im just giving you an example of embedding search as opposed to live boards and things of that nature any questions on just the search experience here from an embedding standpoint client  no i think like again with the embedding what i really love just because like can i change that text can i change these things like all that sort of stuff how does if i put this on a page that has a bunch of other client elements can i have poker elements with this does that you know does that work or do seem to be the whole page like stuff like that id really love to see company employee,0.9936,0.216,0.042,0.742
med,lost,demo,company employee  yeah okay and one more way that ill show you that and ill get i think one good way to show that is through the developer portal which ill ill toggle into company and show you but what ive shown you so far is really just the its the embed sdk so taking like a chart or a search bar or whatever and embedding that like thats what ive shown you up to this point but the other thing that we have like if you really want to customize stuff weve got rest api like a search data rest api were like this chart for example is not a company chart this is just an open source chart right but if you just want to go pull data and company we can make rest api calls retrieve data through the past by the end point you know we receive it as client for something like this and then we can render in whatever it is that you want to do so just know that thats something that youve got at yourremoved    removed disposal if you really want to customize down to the find this level of granularity typically folks will do a little bit of both right so obviously you can you can use both in conjunction with one another one other thing and then ill ill jump into that developer portal let me show you really quickly let me just go into one more component here because i think this could potentially be interesting for you all and ill show you this on the back end as well but we have a capable thats called custom actions so if you want to initiate workflows and company where somebody sees some data like this is just as a chart here obviously that theyve run a search to to generate and they want to maybe take something and move it to another application to perform some action we have a feature called custom actions and so for instance if i click this generate forecast option here in this example were going to send this data to a an application called pie carrot to run a generate a forecast  data architecture  company employee  and then there will be some orchestration there the way that weve got this one set up it will write that data back to third party vendor company will re query third party vendor so you know imagine having a workflow that you can initiate from company and then it returns a forecast for example right  data architecture ends  company employee  so if youve got endpoints that you want have like maybe somebody brings up a list of something and they want to go take that list and send it somewhere or you could use custom actions to to start that process and then return some results those actions can be placed in a number of different places the the example i showed you here was just in the menu where you where you post it but ill give you a feel for what that looks on the back end any questions on that just the one other thing i wanted to just point out here quickly okay so let me log into company and im going to go into the developer portal okay so if i go to develop a couple of things to point out here so this is really kind of a central place where the developers would spend their time and obviously theres i mean probably goes without saying theres documentation so if people want examples of code like they could just go search and look through the docs and figure out sorts of stuff out right which is stuff that developers typically want to do but theres also a playground right now weve got a playground for our visual embed sdk soon were releasing our rest api playground where folks can even you know do rest calls and test those out and see the results in real time and whatnot and then part of i think of where youre interested client is on the customization so styling its something that you can control and so things like logos within the company you i obviously you can do logos and stuff on your ui which you might not even need to customize company logo like your logos within company because you can hide the banners you can hide all that stuff but within the charts you can choose fonts within the tables you can choose spots you can change colors on the background to match your colors if youve got navigation panel so you can change those and then the chart colorremoved    removed palette you can define and you know you can put things like footers and page titles these are the key styling functionalities that we have now theyll be releasing more theres even a feature where this is enough actually this isnt ga yet but theres like a direct css integration that is in beta i guess is probably the best way to put it so if you need to interact directly with the css you can do that too and by the way i mean from an embedding standpoint probably you know you can set up security and and some other things here i actually this demo environment i guess i need to upgrade to have access to that but you know setting up sso and all that security stuff you can you can control here as well very briefly custom actions this is that workflow orchestration component but generate forecast as an example so you can put actions in different places within the charts in the menus like as a primary space and you know if you wanted to to look at existing actions you know like weve got a whole bunch of different things sending data to hubspot or ignite or whatever accounting all sorts of things that you can do here im just again its a ui and theres some advanced settings and things that you can do here as well so again we dont need we can go deep on this at some point if you want but i just wanted to point this out so youre aware that it exists client real quick i know youve got a job maybe lets talk about localization for a few and then if if if you all are cool we can jump back in to this after client has to jump is that cool with you,0.9984,0.115,0.025,0.861
med,lost,company product,client  yeah thats true company employee  okay so localization so when you connect to a table in company its gonna create met a data and company so the tables are gonna have column names and you know of course will be values within those columns so whenever we create that met a data its based on what were connecting to now it sounds like youve got some sort of api layer that sits between your ui and the table name that in real time does that translation is that client  is that company employee  layer is that a custom built layer that you guys have  data management  functions ends  client  yeah and aside from language theres also things like you know what is the companies you know home time zone what is the companies currency you knowremoved    removed things like that so anybody tickets within those companies when theyre interacting those settings and apply okay company employee  yeah client  no its not really like necessarily like bremoveder based i dont think its more based on their companies configuration client  client company employee  yeah so whenever client  me if im wrong if you know differently on any of company employee  those company employee  yeah unless k i was so it sounds like when someone logs into your app based on their profile and all the things about who they are before it queries post grass or third party vendor or whatever its going to do this translation and then the data will come back translated if im if im understanding properly and i think youre right about that and we might have lost client yeah client  thats okay company employee  so when we connect client  sorry its not its not the data like the data is whatever they input it has its own holidaycompany employee removed    removed  columns client  like its the semantic layer terminology client  okay so were introduce company employee  so heres where my head is that here so right now we have a certain set of sources that we support connecting to,0.9906,0.156,0.024,0.821
med,lost,onboarding, data architecture  company employee  obviously we we wouldnt natively connect to your api layer we would connect to your database right but we if we can connect your api layer so that would be a challenge we have a feature set that were releasing in the next few months called parameters which feels like it would sort of do the same thing  data architecture ends  company employee  now it wouldnt tie in directly with your api layer so wed probably have to have a conversation where we go a little bit deeper if youre if theres interest in understanding how we might solution this but it might require that parameters feature on our side which isnt quite ga and the product yet to do that  data architecture  company employee  so i know were short on time here but like that would be something we would have to figure out how would we do that i know some folks will have a service built into third party vendor for example where it does this dynamic layer and if that were the case like we could connect to third party vendor and it would  data architecture ends ,0.9822,0.14,0.0,0.86
med,lost,next steps,company employee  but if youve built a custom be a challenge that wed have to figure out how how we might be able to help out thereremoved    removed company employee  so maybe what we do if youre interested if this seems like something that could provide value to go do you guys we could do a deeper dive on that i could bring in some folks to maybe you know put our heads together on that you know at at some other point in time client  we could we could just hold on an item and yeah we can we can circle internally and come back on that company employee  yeah perfect okay cool okay so,0.9851,0.247,0.0,0.753
med,lost,company product,company employee  kind of client and overall coming back here but let me talk a little bit about the developer playground so you guys can get a feel for how this works and so obviously lets lets go look at this so if i want to see this developer playground live what the way that this works is theres going to be just a sample apps that loads up and the idea here is that im a developer could come in here and start building this app and having company right code that they can then take and work with right and so for instance if a developer said you know what we want to expose our retail sales dataset in our application right i could choose something like that this is basically just putting an argument in the playground and then let me maximize this so i can see the bottom of the screen if i click run youll notice that when i do this of course it wrote the code here focusing on the retail sales app thats been loaded it up or maybe we want to hide the data paying them it will write the code high data sources true and again youll refresh the app now we dont have a data panel on the left here you can even do things like modify the search as a starter search so if we want someone to maybe look at you know store sales by store region right it will write the code you can run this and now your your is pre loaded up with a search of course the the developers who are going to do things more interesting than just having hard coated search terms in here but thats something that they could use as a starting point and then sort of make this really cool but this gives them the sort of live feedback back and forth to get in and start to play with and build this and then build some of the code as a as a starting point the same thing that were seeing of course you could test out im embedding search but you can embed live boards or visualizations or the full app or whatever it happens to be in the same playground this playground is going to roll out here in the next few months for the rest api as well and so if you wanted to test those things are all the same sort of experience the same layout hereclient removed    removed  any questions on  the general idea here  no i dont think so company employee client company employee  and you know one thing i guess in that ill point out i mean if you go to the visual bed sdk doc one thing that the developer played around doesnt show i mean it shows you all the code but obviously there are things to like get started you know here are the authentication options heres maybe what you need to white list list and your whole staff preparing the environment installing the sdk so theres a few things that you would do in your app to sort of make this possible but those are things that developers will know exactly what to do kind of walking through this so account executive  hello client  here we could look into like all the different sort of options for chart types that are possible theres and theres also as a strong use case for us wanting to publish our own charts and you know have users log in and they can see you know a couple of standard things and we you know wed like to be able to have you know more than just like you have multiple series on one chart or you know do a couple of do some more advanced things if if possible company employee  yeah for sure i mean theres a couple of options there so if youre doing visual embed like you know looking at like if we go real quick and just lets look at like lets go back into controllers here and maybe we look at selfservice if youre using the visual embed and youre looking at we have region yeah something like this right youre gonna have access if you want to to like the the native charts where people could go in and choose from all the charts that are part of the company library and you know itll sort of inherently give them guidance you know hey in this when you need to managers to do align column for example right youll get all that stuff if you wanted to build your own sort of chart navigation you know the rest api you can sort of do anything you want you could even do maybe a little bit of a like a hybrid where you you know in the visual embed if i were to embed embed a visualization instead of an entire you know chart right like like lets see here well i need to go find one that would be good but you know imagine this is one chart you want to embed and then you have another chart thats like the line version of this for example but you know expose this entire menu to them itsremoved    removed like your app calling out to one version or the other and you have the control so that they have maybe less spend less control to choose all the stuff they want you could use a combination of these things and so maybe behind the scenes you have two searches where you just choose to expose the search in your app lets hey do you want a line chart or do you want to column chart and they get the navigating your app and then it calls out to company to pull this the right answers based on what they choose in europe so a number of ways that you can orchestrate that basically does that kind of where  data management  functions  client  going with it came from a charting standpoint client  yeah i think you company employee  yep and then of course i mean weve been talking about charts it sounds like you guys are doing a lot of just data tables and whatnot i mean you can obviously do those things you can do if you want to do pivot tables as well wheres my pivot here somewhere actually let me go back to this maybe we have pivot table turned off am i not seeing it yeah account executive  yeah company employee  okay cool thank you where to go so you know if you want to pay the data people like to do that you can obviously install pivot tables as well or you can expose pivot tables for whatever reason  data management  functions ends  company employee  this one isnt showing but last maybe theres training for me at this pull it up here yeah alright well there we go so you can you can sort of do some pivoting and and whatnot and you know people can play around with that and app as well so and then of course folks will have within each chart a configuration panel where they can come in and and sort of swap things around and choose some different options and all that sort of good stuff so thats one of the advantages of using the embed sdk is you just benefit from all the features that are already there you dont have to build any of that stuff cool what other questions do you have on any of the the charting stuff hereremoved    removed client  i think im there from a training perspective client  when you did you mentioned sharing of those this realizations and how does the yeah as a sharing works and what does the other users see company employee  when when you sharon yeah let me go here real quick so theres a couple of things im just im back in company yeah so let me just show you because i dont know what i have exposed from the sharing standpoint in that app you can expose the ability for folks to share within the charts and if i were to save this just call this like a test  pinboard  company employee  sure if if somebody has created something they want to share youll have the ability to to expose you know people to go maybe we want to share with edgar right and give edgar view or edit access youll be able to expose this type of information in your app and the sharing is something thats available for really any type of object whether its a live board you know if you want to come in here and like you could even expose a list page like this if you wanted or you could build your own this page but youll notice that you know you can share from within list client  pages like company employee  this or you can share from within the actual content with the with the icon here same type of deal but you know and and i think you can even share within a live board you can share do you have an individual charts or objects themselves as well  pinboard ends  client  can you can you embed you guys have any any sort of embed of these like whether its on on slack or team messages or emailcompany employee removed    removed  to embed the charts themselves like yeah so were building a slack integration like yeah i mean you could use our api to do that right now but were building a slack integration where its because its such a popular app where you could say send to slack and it would just be a feature that you could enable and it would pop the chart in there for you its not yeah go ahead client  cool company employee  yeah do you guys and youll youll use slack a decent amount client  it will be for it again with him when he is with that is with for customers who will have to be customers that are using slack internally we also have a our own client messaging app which that will be another cool way to cool embed these widgets within our messaging out yeah i think company employee  that that is the messaging out that exist within your app when your customers log in they can use the messaging yeah i mean i think that might be a good example so we wouldnt obviously least at this point have a out of the box connector that we would that we would have for that because its your own custom app but you you would you could use custom actions to do something like that i would imagine orchestrate that like hey send the client messenger right yeah and so that can be pretty cool client  show us like unfortunately a lot of our customers love paper so they would likely want to export this to a pdf to print it they also might want to export things to excel to play at the more are those features available  pinboard  company employee  yeah so you could expose that in the ui like download the pdf for example let me show you youll even have some hey which of these charts do you want in your pdf you know do you want it one big picture do you want it landscape portrait so youll have some options that you could do from the ui pinboard ends  company employee removed    removed  but since youre embedding you might actually want to just work with our api us and have your own like buttons to do exporting and control things so weve got api for export as well and if i were to like lets go here for example within a chart i can download the images  data drill down  company employee  if im looking at the data and tabular fashion ill have some options to download csv et cetera so and again theyre kpis too so you can you could go a number of different ways with that the other thing here is i might have showed you this last time like this is even though this is a table its sort of still aggregate data because youre grouping it at the month and the product level  data drill down ends  company employee  so at any point if folks want to get raw data you can always use the show underlying data option and so you could do it like at a page level like this or you could you know do it you know here and just kinda get access to all the raw records and allow folks to download from that point you know pick and choose some columns or whatever and then they could do that so thats an option as well to get down to the raw data if you want to do expose that and yeah its it should be available in not just the tables but the charts too so,0.9999,0.16,0.018,0.822
med,lost,next steps,company employee  yeah lets think so that was exporting data what other questions on this do you have company employee  and by the way one thing i can we can send you as a follow up is if you if you go to developers dot company dot com theres actual documentation tutorials that community here so if you go into docs if you want to look through like any of these its organized pretty well where you can go in and either search or just kinda look at all the stuff here so feel free to you know play around in here and check stuff out as you want and theres even a you know like a playground here so developers that company dot com if youre interested in digging around later company employee  lets think what else yeah what other kind of burning questions do you guys have about this or really anything company wiseclient removed    removed  broke i know you just i say to send through a few customer examples maybe you guys talk through some of them in particular what but the things that i wanna make sure are like handle like a very high customer logic im not sure how you set it up in terms of like if its based on the concurrent users or phone number of users or you know making sure that can handle the capacity that client would have also that like permissions would be seamless like a user wouldnt have to go to things or wouldnt have but that at all and make sure and also that you know we could use our permissions that we set up an client to like dictate their permissions and some concern example that sort of thumbs things company employee  yeah sure and with name which did you did you send some examples in the chat here you might have just sent him an account executive  yeah i sent it via email company employee  got it got it got it account executive  removed cw t really beautiful embedded example company employee  okay yeah so maybe what we do so ill let me address your first question about capacity,0.9948,0.177,0.017,0.806
med,lost,deployment options, deployment options  account executive  okay company employee  so theres i mean you could do this two ways big picture like that spot cloud which is saas so you dont maintain any like of the infrastructure or anything right like its its company cloud that systems hosted there and it just sort of integrates via these sdk is an api with your platform were very way where do you guys host client is that like in your own cloud or third party vendor or third party vendor or is it im trying to remember where the ap is yes sorry say it again client  third party vendorremoved    removed company employee  okay yeah our staff is hosted in third party vendor too so which doesnt matter one way or the other but just so youre aware we host ours in third party vendor you can choose region so if youve got you know we we have a selection of regions so you can sort of put it next to your app and then just integrated that way if you wanted to host company yourself you can obviously do that as well of course if you do that then youre on the hook for sizing and operations and all the servers and stuff you know we help you and support you with that but bottom line is we would work with you to understand your how many users you would have kind of the the usage patterns all those types of things  deployment options ends ,0.977,0.127,0.009,0.864
med,lost,pricing,company employee  okay yeah our staff is hosted in third party vendor too so which doesnt matter one way or the other but just so youre aware we host ours in third party vendor you can choose region so if youve got you know we we have a selection of regions so you can sort of put it next to your app and then just integrated that way if you wanted to host company yourself you can obviously do that as well of course if you do that then youre on the hook for sizing and operations and all the servers and stuff you know we help you and support you with that but bottom line is we would work with you to understand your how many users you would have kind of the the usage patterns all those types of things  deployment options ends  company employee  and we would size you know if youre doing this on your own like we would help you size company if effectively and then for us like you dont have to worry about that you we just kind of as part of the hey heres heres what were gonna do with client like we just want to understand what youre doing so we make sure that your system does sized appropriately and whatnot so yeah so thats sort of account executive  go ahead i guess what what type of scale or what type of scale as far as users in any capacity good are you do you typically see out of a customer or maybe if you can give us like a rain client  i dont have a number of where my head for like concurrent users thats super hard to and i guess i assume theres a different one just viewing data versus doing it company employee  yeah yeah i mean yeah its kinda probably looks similar to you guys you look at it and named users then logged in users then people actually doing stuff interactively  search types  company employee  so yeah i mean if youre just viewing something versus youre interacting its going to be a little bit more load interacting obviously so client  okay what are what are some of the skills of customers or other customers youve had have like you know do the you know if you do have any wins fromremoved    removed the scale of like many thousands of users  search types ends  company employee  yeah bt is a monster removed weve got strangely enough weve got a company thats not theyre not actually a massive company but they just one come to head its a company called drc so they do all the standardized testing for like high schools and whatnot for a lot of the states they have contract the states and so theyve got teachers in company looking at their test scores and theyve got i mean i dont know tens or hundreds of thousands of people that are in the system so weve weve got some big customers for sure i would probably what i do to get off the top of my head i dont have a good feel for like specific numbers but we can we can certainly have conversations with folks if if youre some point to give you a better feel for this specific account executive  yeah yeah i know the removed is you know i think last time we had that count like one point removed  search types  account executive  so if youre talking thousands or tens of thousands i mean definitely within scale and you know company can handle very well client  thats good to hear yeah i im struggling other vendors were you know you dive into like examples and you didnt need to kind of quickly realize that theyre not sure about our scale and thats obviously an area of concern  pricing  client  i think thats mainly all my questions i dont know like im not what your what your pricing model is like what is the im gonna say users or capacity or what have you i but i dont i dont mind asking for any numbers or anything that im just sort of curious with the model is account executive  yeah so so we can be flexible on the the type of model that you want done and its exactly what you just said it can be users or it could be capacity right so its the same way that we sell just the you know internal use case what we call company enterpriseremoved    removed  search types  account executive  its all capacity by billions of removed of data that youre going to be searching on or we can do it by users which is like in minutes searching and working in in company within your your portal so either way works typically you know the customer is searching on just like petabytes of data billions and billions and hundreds of billions of removed of data  pricing  account executive  the capacity model means that its gonna be much more expensive because youre paying for how much youre searching on so in a case like that you know a customer most likely go with the credit route the the consumption around and vice versa right if youre not searching on massive amounts of data but you have tons and tons of users well then maybe the classy actually makes more sense from a pricing model so those are the thats kind of the balance the conversations we have with customers especially when its an embedded use case and it would be you know an exercise that we go through with with you all as well,0.9994,0.172,0.01,0.818
med,lost,next steps,client  make sense yeah so client  thats one off sorry account executive  youre good good sorry client  i gotta account executive  noisy background so im going in and out between mute client  would you be able to send us some more information about that im developer playground i think you know we need to sort of discuss what we wanna do inremoved    removed terms of next steps but that might include what im more engineering focused color and all of exploratory pick out ahead of time company employee  yeah for sure well send you a follow up with some links and then i think client youre youre spot on if you did you guys want to do a little bit of a deeper dive we can do a call with engineering and id probably bring on one of our sort of more engineering focused solutions engineers  agenda ends  company employee  so maybe name it or name they they know this stuff inside now so they can talk the same language with those folks good so so yeah happy to do that well send you a link to develop a playground stuff and obviously if questions come up i mean i know you had some questions about authentication all those are things we can talk about too  agenda  company employee  if we get someone like name for name on the phone with yours folks so happy to happy to answer questions as you have them just feel free to reach out the name well so client  okay company employee  cool client  if we were going to if one of our next steps is a lets create a psc or a pilot how do you guys engage and its something that we built ourselves or  agenda ends  company employee  yeah well i mean we i guess theres there can be a couple of yeah so what i tend to see with folks that are looking to do embedding mean youre engineers are gonna want to do a lot of the work to sort of test it out and see what it feels like so we would certainly help and educlient and we would do things like office hours or answer questions establish some of those contacts but yall would probably beremoved    removed wanting to test out hey can i embed this into my ap and what does it look like and those types of things so from a just actual hands on work keyboard standpoint that tends to be the case and and embedding scenario now obviously were experts on our company application so when it comes to like hey whats the best way to connect to third party vendor and how do we model the data out,0.9988,0.223,0.007,0.77

processing is being done kind of what is the stage of that dataclient so client i mean i have a my perspective but if you could please hotline how how the environment was built and what its purposes yeah etl the process the processclient yeah so the the the possibly i think so what what does the process questions on how it is built soclient hello hello is it differentiate yeah go aheadsales engineer yeah like what i mean when when you say process i mean what is it just combining a bunch of different data sources into a singular scheme of the data is that what its meant by processing or you know what just what whats the state of thatclient right yeah no its all its all the data the data so we are in the process layer is where we bc ingest it so lets go to the role and other

know so the data gets updated correctly so we ensure that regardless of the method of funds if you guys have a method of the way the data is being sent to us speed for loads incremental loads incident only is upside data management  functions clientremoved  removed so we we thought all that out in the process now okay we do some standardization there might be some might enrichment in additional columns that might facilitate then to actually stitched together the data be unprocessed okay the first modeled version is in the layer called prepared so thats a layout further downstreamclient and so there we we basically added arrogant edits or a good keys weve got a a formal logical and physical model that logical we will use our filings but a lot of physical model and prepared and then that thats really where we are then in in a hyper scale so you could see it on here yeah thanks thanks bye bye so the process layer as we said thats thats where thats where the thats kind of the mirror off the source okay really its typically typically independent living on what what the source but in most cases if you have a relational database all the way on the left the process there is an exact its its its a replica essentially have that okay as the city i would contain duplication for example if you got five updates right you would have the same same data point five times in the possibly depending on how we model or whether we want to look more like a slowly like little bit legislature that mentioned where they would check history whether we do roll versioning like the different methods of modeling as well theres there was waving model these tables and process but by and large its its its its similar to the source okay and then you dont waste cheaper right now shows the consumption layer that is really where we start building a formal formal model data model and and yeah and and thats based on sequel hyper scale by now does that does that helpsales engineer it does very much thank you so in that consumption layer once weve done and hyper scale today is that not only applying kind of have a you know formal kind of relational model back to the data but is it also since i see tower third party vendor and third party vendor there i mean are are you do an aggregate levels and kind of summary and different views of that data to enable that type of reportingclient yeah its its correct so theyre going to be to be frank thats sort of like two layers in that consumption layer okay actually i can probably share different diagram which is sort of like a diagnosis more recent let me let me quickly share diagram here give me one moment thank you data management  functions ends sales engineer me the context apologize if youre repeating something that happened in an earlier conversationclientremoved  removed no no drama and now i just confuse all of you now because also certain powers that be have decided that the name should be renamed so so just quickly quickly ignore what you saw on the previous slide a couple of naming and ill try to put this in context so not my decision somebody else too soon to rename this so essentially what you previously saw here while i still the wrong that this was the approve the the the process and they want to rename it delta data management  functions client okay and then really there to last confirmed so this is sort of the integrated data sets at the most feasible granular level so this is this is really the this is the first layer level in sequel hyper scale okay and then theres a business layer where you get the summarization and maybe right transformation for specific of potential use cases okay so these are some of the the list that we have i think fairless barely standard architecture overall id say but yes and the hyper scale we we essentially have these two and we dont always build this right so this is typically happens of course when the data sets a larger heavily transformed you might get these two layers theyre not always now but we do we do have these to both of them have formal models these last but down here we we we dont model right so busy down here now what i will say the data set stays in ugly right so we are not doing you know we are merging data said,0.9982,0.119,0.027,0.854

med,lost,company product,sales engineer one one thing i do want to point out just kinda kinda goes into some of those points i think in some of the differences between us and those other clouds and actually yard and can you put that back up speak to that architecture slide the the big shift that yard in spoke about us making in the last year two years of not having to bring a copy of the data in in the company cloud side of things no data is stored in the actual company cloud we dont actually copy the data from client into company even even to save dancers are saved pin boards that you built and ive shared with colleagues we are saving the sequel hello structure behind those that when you go to view it again it is again reaching out to the client side and retrieving that result set so that is one of the reasons why oftentimes the security teams do give us the green light but im just wanted to say that just to make sure that this architecture here is kind of understood that embrace layer just above client is that kinda live query process as opposed to a copy and load the data into company processname sorry this is she might have one very basic questions so ive had some experience working on company currently for our different clients and but selling point for company was looked at in memory database you just load the data its going to be very fast the reporting layer connect you to company what absolutely fine but what im hearing now was that we have to totally erased the idea that company is in memory database its more like a plug and play on up as of now im seeing the data storage client which is the delta leg in future data architecture ends name it could be anything else so what is the value of what company has bringing here compact with the otheraccount executive good question yeah so just summarizing your point youre  percent right what our customers were telling us was that they dont want to move data into yet another location in order to be able to analyze itremoved  removed industry issues account executive so very much in line with our customers feedback we modeled our entire business so that were always working from the most up to date source of truth from that data layer and the company value proposition very simply has always been how can we easily enable business users to ask questions from data without having to write sequel so thats always been our mission in in a search driven interface right so reducing business backlog so business users can ask questions on their own versus having to go to an analyst or the bi team every time they have a new question to ask thats the core or mission company always had we talked a lot about the cloud now not having to move data live query working with the most up to date data,0.9895,0.085,0.006,0.909

med,lost,company product, use cases account executive so if in theory somebody in in in inventory management position wanted to look at a specific skew of an item sitting in a hardware in a in a in a storage or im on a shelf at a specific time of day you can drill into that extremely detailed data point and hyper personalized the data for exactly what youre looking for is the business data management  functions name i have one question said that data stored is going to be on like how was the how was company can enable that is are you going to are you guys building an impact in the background or how is that possible because if im going to if data is already there and data to excel dave im putting it it some time search types name okay be the data because the data is already stored in the database so are you providing you with which dusters are you doing some optimization how was the how was the possibleremoved  removedsales engineer so we do some indexing but the indexing is purely for search purposes so to enable that search experience like the the type ahead and the search history that youve done before everything that makes up company user experience so simple data architecture sales engineer but we are relying on client and delta like in this case to have that compute power for the response some of the queries and thats why you you mentioned when you were talking about the connecting other data sources we do have a smaller list of connectors and other traditional bi tools because we require them to be extremely performance to drive that fast search experience just like if any of us where to go tothird party vendor and it spins for a minute or two minutes were going to close it and go to some other search and search types name hello the company which is going to be provided by data breaks but internally you know search index or something like that which enables they use this to query the data fast resales engineer enable to search suggestions so youd be indexes are not like true kind of traditional database indexes for performance purposes its more for the user experienced okay perfect okay,0.9842,0.091,0.007,0.902

med,lost,company product, use cases account executive that would be fantastic grand i know weve discussed for the sake of the proof of concept and inventory management use case that was top of mind and timely is that still the case and if so can we you share a little bit more about thatclient in inventory in terms of its availability in the in the day like is is not there thats something that we have in process data management  functions client something were working on there are a number of tables that we need to bring in put it into our process layer and ultimately build a model and are prepared layer so at that point then we could circle back into the process layer and make it available for data like for the purpose of the po si data transfer client however we can we can do something that were doing in the interim which is to take from whatever sql servers databases which as snapshots of our inventory which basically has the kind of the pretty much the final set of data that were going to any way build only one from our native assets sql tables so basically simulating what would we have at the end of the day after we do all of our data engineering so and we do we need to do that anyway in order to pull the data in for historical snapshot so so that would be that would be our approach there use cases client but makes it easy there is that basically its one one big table that has everything already altogether so for the purpose of a plc we spend less time data modeling and more time getting and user feedback we also have some requirements from the team where theyre very interested in being able to take inventory data and combining it with forecast or demand or inventory you know comparing a supply forecast the demand forecasts data management  functions clientremoved  removed so these are all the other data sets that were building up but step one is getting access to core inventory data and that would again that would be our approach is to leverage what weve already built out pull that in and be able too you know show how it can be much easier to analyze the data that the business is used to using it instead of having to go and grab the data export it create more dashboards and so forth data management  functions ends client of course were were looking at a very much from an end user point of view i wanna make sure however that from an install point of view firms getting is up and running in terms of being able to get the approvals to do that were all on the same page so that way you know as long lead time so that once we get the business interest of this we dont want to put them on pause for six months you know its important that we are you know able to move quickly once once we all are on the same page data transfer sales engineer and is that the process today client you said they have to download data to an excel file and do some kind of shaping a modeling themselves and then upload that back to build a dashboard on top of itclient sure because what we have right now and our sql database is not something that they actually query and build the build anything and they have to move it to another place data transfer ends client you know its just basically a you know a  year old not even the day like its just a bunch of tables that are out there that they can query against and move them someplace else so its not very user friendly so what happens is and its happening all over the company people in the data thats a good place together data management  functions client they grab it they build their own little mini mini data towers and they go to work and then we have this proliferation of data models and no central us already or control so the idea here is now that we are building a video we do this from the etl and we have the flexibility to give users and easy way to kind of do what theyreremoved  removeddoing right now without having to do a lot of data modeling so thats what we want to prove out our plc dont go through that use a tool like this and quickly be able to to to do what you need to dosales engineer got it okay and that that one big table i mean can you defined big for me just logging scaryclienti dont have a row row count on this but i can get back to you on thatsales engineeri mean do do you know how wide it is as wellclientits pretty its pretty big i mean youre talking about youll be talking about all of the all of the inventory across you know the entire world i mean we have tens of thousands of skews we have you know many suppliers we have you know many manufacturing facilities you know distribution centers its a camp very complex network sosales engineer okay and so this is the table then that moving from the process so the prepared layer is kind of d normalized into a relational structure with the with the keys and relationships between them data transfer client well i mean this table this table is already done because this is are all kinds of sql environment its already been kind have theres already a process in place that when the month and take that take all that data create a snapshot of it and save it off into another place thats what were talking about here data management  functions client wed be kind of replicating that and and client by taking the native tables pretty much not adding a lot to that but just creating a a method going forward thats more sustainable and also being able to combine it with other data sets so but were not there yet to to be able to use that final end model for inventory but we can leverage what weve already builtremoved  removed okaysales engineersales engineer use cases  and i imagine given the size and scope of that table does contain all the different data elements that would be a part of any question and then use or would haveclient  operational inventory analysis yes okaysales engineername i have one question regarding the performance metrics what we talked about right data architecture name so since the compute and the data store is going to be data breaks the performance metrics is mobility clue what name has set right so what im trying to understand is is there any specific performance metrics company has to offer here because the computer is going to be on client the data is already organized on totally prepared as the platform is coming from the performance most of this off most of the tools or the bi tools right they have a computer engineering and the performance indicator is based on that but when you say that company has a performance indicate when you mentioned that youre compared with other tools i feel that theres more related to client with this the data store as of now versus the company software itself is my understanding right search types sales engineer youre talking about pure compute and processing time yes oftentimes when were talking about performance and speed as well were talking about speed for an end user to get the answer to their question as well so its and also i mean just to what client was just talking about about trying to reduce the proliferation of data across the enterprise and trying to kinda reduce

med,lost,onboarding, onboarding process account executive thats a huge accomplishment milestone but we are also getting them up to speed on our conversations so far and why you are client from our understanding looking to re engage with company so without reading too much from these slides anything you want to put in your own words so that were all aligned going into this today and kinda starting this journey again together onboarding process ends client yeah i mean ill just share a few really quick thoughts i know weve talked about this before so its its probably going to be repeat so maybe this will just ground us a little bit right we at removed we have a lot of of stuff built for our home office audience so thats marketers executives right basically anybody but the name is all built in click and then we have some other stuff for the feel forremoved   removedit which is built in third party vendor im not really looking at anything for the name right now although name data right call activity data is in play here but theyre not one of the personas im trying to serve with what were looking to do and what im looking for company to be able to do is to provide a natural language capability so that we have all these all these big beautiful dashboards that have all kinds of stuff in them but for the things that we didnt think of or for that that next level question how do they get those answers the way that they do right now is they have to you know they call an analyst to call somebody from my team who call somebody from the data team and and they do a whole bunch of stuff to try to you know try to figure out which table to pull from and to to get some dataset,0.9696,0.082,0.011,0.907
med,lost,about company, company product client so really what i want from company is to get the humans out of the loop right so you know somebody looks at a dashboard they have an idea of something they want to investigate and then they should be able to do some investigation on their own not data science right company product ends client volume were were definitely talking about short of data science but somewhere more advanced than than a dashboard thats basically what im looking to do it is an usales engineerl battle right i dont i want to be clear company is not a preferred technology here at removed that doesnt mean that company is off the table about company client it means that you know were going to hear from our it organization hey we have all these other tools for you why why are you why are you looking at company so i need i need to see what company could do that kind of sets it apart from click within sight bought and tell yes and even to some extent third party vendor although you know i would say that you could look at third party vendor as in a very similar places company in that it is not a preferred capability at removed about company ends client but it is what we felt we needed and so we got it right so client and i being on the business side were at liberty to choose whatever tool we want but of course you know we have to justify the cost and we have to justify the the work thats going to be involved than doing it so really you know im im looking for yourremoved   removedhelp and how i can address those use cases and im also looking for your help to and a push that boulder up a hill so that if company is the right choice were able to when thataccount executive absolutely thank you for that i think were very much aligned with our understanding of why were here today as far as how to help you make the business case obviously youre not going to be able to go ask for an investment if there isnt business value that were providing thats exponentially higher than the cost that you guys would be investing in us,0.9868,0.102,0.015,0.883
med,lost,onboarding,account executive so were very much aligned on resources available to make that a reality and part of that is going to be kind of going down this journey of a proof of concept and what sales engineer and i had discussed is firstly today we can go over what it does it actually take to make company search experience come to life so connecting to third party vendor in the to build it takes on your teams end so theres clear expectations of whats actually required and then ultimately begin building out this proof of concept use case which the end goal would be how do we actually one assigned dollar value to this,0.7893,0.068,0.0,0.932
med,lost,onboarding,account executive that it would provide either incremental value to your team or be able to cut off resources that your team does have in order to for example like a backlog you described so calling the data analyze all the resources that requires on your end if we can put a dollar amount that will save on that cost agenda account executive thats ultimately how well be able to help me make a business case does that sound good as a starting pointclient it does to meaccount executive okay joy anything to add any questions youre muted sorry,0.9524,0.196,0.031,0.773
med,lost,onboarding,sales engineer sorry yeah no that thats a great starting point i you know i think towards the whole notion of how do we have drive the value of the questions we havent lost and things like that weve seen demos of it of course the to fulfill it comes down in experiencing some of that so you can quantify that so im and i think you both seen enough of the enough company demo agenda ends sales engineer so i dont need to repeat that for now let me just take you to the zero search so you understand that how it is and even even on such a system if i had to do some of the sport i could ever take what you know what maybe driving some of this so you get to see what is it gonna take for you to get data what what is the type of the lets definitely yesclient so speaking of the lift could i just i just wanted to bring up one other thing which is that you know the more that we need to involve our internal partners the more partners that we need to win right data architecture client so i mean i think ive mentioned before i know i spoke to company years ago and it was a really heavy lift it was like you gotta move all your data into company i understand that weve come a long way since then but still i one of the things that i want to include in the proof of concept is like actually connecting to third party vendor here right,0.9554,0.094,0.01,0.895
med,lost,demo,client where im not im not looking at a proof of concept where youre just going to show us the natural language search im going to send you a bunch of excel documents in there you go hey look right i actually the proof of concept has to go into the architecture you know search types ends account executive yeah and to your point when i say understand the left i should also say the or the lack thereof because its very minimal resources wise and i think youll be able to see that very soon so to your point its its not like you have to involve theremoved   removedentire i see organization or the entire cv the consumer the nbs x i believe its called like its very much plug and play compare to how it was in the pastsales engineer client to your point right up your seats on i mean we take our view on this has always been the better the better you are informed and what it takes for you to be successful with company the more likely have heard of you being a successful customers to us and thats a good place we want we want you to experience all things we see what it takes and then go into the eyes open this is what the business value this is the effort required gotcha okay perfectclientsales engineer right so should i dont just get into that quickly just so focus again for now is just if you were to do something like this against lets say a third party vendor environment how would you go about bringing data and sharing that it so let me start with that so able to see my screen yes youveclientsales engineer seen lots of company and a demo set again as i said i wont focus on that im gonna focus on specifically connecting to a third party vendor environment picking a set of people that are important to your use case and such in that process so that process is what we call this data management  functions sales engineer so just you go to search right and its a full step process the first to name create the second to greatly have for the user adoption so let me talk about those steps step one you connect to the database step too because set of tables that are important for the subject areas analysis right so you may have postings of tables you dont need thousands of people so thats up to date if im the feed for supporting of course that may not be the use case lets just say that i have cuba tables ive got a you know like alignment table that but some additional name on pacing and you know my targets things like that those are the two those are going to take that step too far step two is if youve got primary key foreign key relationship really havent that if you dont have you can define that step three years to say i have this i have these tables technical names probably they dont meanremoved   removedclienthello sales engineer are you sharing your screen or i ever tohi miss thesales engineerclient agenda gc one screen which is our best and demo but im not sure whether youre walking throughsales engineer it should say yep this space yes doubles demo yet thats why i was just talking about the things that step three is that you defined business terms and synonyms so that business users can use the user and step for us to say though i may have you know making your situation is gonna have peoples things like that agenda ends sales engineer so rather than users speaking people you know this column from one once they have another call them from another table every time someone has the same lets say its a market checkout version defining that on the fly to find anything that you that people need once so you can get to it so in that sense its very similar to a third party vendor project in that sense but a much much later right and then thats what do you make available users thats the four step process we go through so lets talk about that so how does it begin remember step button data management  functions sales engineer im gonna add a connection so when i click add a connection im just gonna call this my demo right now lets say im going to get third party vendor had continue and of course theres other sources i imagine its third party vendor is is the primary target that you happen to know right now data management  functions ends sales engineer and so and third party vendor again we can use for if you wanted to do possible authentication of user information im not sure that how you manage security if youre managing the underlying data source and you want us to use a third party vendorremoved   removedlogin where we use it we can absolutely do that or if you wanna use a service account you can do that too and so let me just go ahead and put in my service account information there data architecture client yeah so let me let me just right away with just connecting to thought to to third party vendor so lets lets just start here so my first question for you is like are you where whereas company running its its its in the cloud right is it on a is it an on an removed and the removed cloud deployment options client is it is company running it and we have to create a connection to the removed cloud to get the third party vendor how does that typically set upaccount executive the client you can deploy however youd like we have company cloud which is fully manage softwares software as a service on company and we also have the option to deploy in your cloud so it can be a ws asher et cetera data management  functions client and when you do if if we have you manage it whats your typical arrangement with so for access to the data do you typically find that you need tps in place with all of our data providers third party agreements orsales engineer in in in some cases i mean i think cuba sort of replies that for your people right data management  functions ends sales engineer so those would be you would be a better judge them that i know that they do ask for i give you if youre using i keep it is sometimes they do ask for thatclientremoved   removed yeah right so like you have just one right we use i cube via and symphony and deployment options sales engineer yep yeah so youd have to make sure that setup yes okay yeah again company its really not going to be looking at it but i think being system on that right keep anclient well i mean its the so the third party agreement is an agreement between company and i cube via right its an its an agree at removed is actually not a party to the agreement its just an agreement that is required that that you know our agreement with iq via for example requires that if were getting data to somebody that that you know they have a cpa in place where like you have you deployment options ends client so im sure you have other clients you know you im sure you have i cube via data in company but i i really wanna make sure that we understand that tooaccount executive lets look into that i dont think we know the answer on this call but lets certainly confirm data architecture sales engineer and client another thing to keep in mind is unlike in the old days where youre bringing all the data into memory thats not happening right because we are still gonna query your third party vendor environment in place so so you know in the old days it was like hey i am going to move data over and so it was even more important to make sure that he is always going to be important data transfer client yeah anyway but you so you must be having at least several other met met her at a moviesales engineerremoved   removed data information doesclient it our company instance as well as when you are going to show the outputs that will go into memory and then name on the talk sport front end right which means some part of the process data is want to move to city data transfer ends sales engineer yeah some processes thats it yeah yes yep okay so so lets come back to that so okay lets put a you know the tps on something for us it back down for you client now as we go through this so remember i was talking about you know so im in step one right data architecture sales engineer im connecting to the database ive given my credentials im gonna say continue and so im gonna use these credentials to go retrieve a list of all the tables thats available in third party vendor with name you that this users allowed to see right now good lots of different data sets available data management  functions sales engineer yeah im gonna use you know a simple example just to convey that the concept survey and so in this case ive got three tables name use its a very simple star schemer but you know very very routine especially in the pharmaceutical sales site to have multiple facts as as youve already let him know so ive got here im gonna say hey this table fact because sales he has a problem very very quick heres the data types here some sample value so people can see it you can select individually table to select all right and i just selected all and notice the number went up and do the same for lets say that he gets stored stable and the product we mentioned right and so at this point what ive said is hey here all the different tables in my environment i just wanted to see and then i say create a connection so effectively at this point i am competing step two step one was establishing connectivity into third party vendor step two is picking the tables everyone now as a part of this step as far as feeding the method data in third party vendor to say are there any joins in this have you defined brand new people and the relationships if you have thats how have you repeat all of that work lets just instead of that and so youll notice that i have some join side of it no i was just drag this is my my demo data set the second you know have a lot of other sets as well im just im this is my demo data sets so now that i have this this is where i was saying remember step three and four but just defining business done thats an items and designing the search experience with people to repeat those optionsremoved   removed data management  functions ends sales engineer so right away as ive got this i can actually start searching right so i click on search and and you see that those two tables of that right and i can say show me the sales by region right and as i do that company is seeking those dumps purely based on sales and region come in they are actually columns in column headers right now in my tables right thats good right ive got anclient so sales engineer so so heres heres the thing right so when i look at something like this when we doing a proof of concept at removed will require a an understanding of like you know we talk about regions yes okay we have more geography dimensions then you can imagine every every zip code is aligned to a territory for each of the different businesses that we have there was a percentage rep theres an interest a rep they have different management structures and different hierarchies and even different numbers of levels of the hierarchy so all of that i want all that complexity to be transparent to my users when somebody asks the question about interest though yes it you knowsales engineer thats why i began to right i wanted to talk about tables can be anything right and if you didnt boy right bringing that together so huhclient right but but here but the but the thing is i you know i just really want to emphasize this point that like that this stuff i understand you know we need to start somewhere so im im im tracking with you were good but like i know that company could put on a hell of a demo right but thats different than a proof of concept and that actually accounts for not all of the complexity im not looking for a full company deployment at at removed right onboarding process client but that captures a lot of the complexity and is able to kind of work with us where we actually are you know what i meansales engineer and thats thats exactly what i want you to think of like so you just have one very important thing when we think what youll see is this look like for you to think actively about what is success for you to be able to proceed forward right onboarding process ends removed   removedsales engineer and second i mean yeah and and thats what you wanna make sure we hit because because and so exactly complexity like its pretty standard especially overlapping sales teams alignments are different you know multiple sales whos calling on the same doctor different you know targets all of that its i see that all the time and our customers and youre very comfortable with that but im glad you bring that up because youre going exactly where wed be going to come to account executive is gonna eventually come back what is successful you how do you define it and how would we measure that so we can actually say yes we did at the job or we didnt central yeah,0.9996,0.113,0.033,0.854
med,lost,company product,clientclient hi this is client one for them and do whatever they want to understand is that a lot of these facts and dimensions we sat in the database not calculated metrics what we show in the report okay exactly right yeahsales engineerclient so a simple example like calls per day if i want to show it depends on what are the combination combination of filters venture they use it as selecting on the front end and those are calculated run time based on the combination combination of different things so if you ever want to just connect to that database you are normal know get to the corresponding number data management  functions ends client okay that is a formula which has seven bad i mean it does which is that im in the background to their corresponding okay my calls for the other region little bit different than that that it to be then area that and then at the nation yeah absolutelysales engineerclientremoved   removed if anyones especially holiday dear so there are a lot of photos which we use on the front end to to get to what exactly calls per day and im what im looking for so how do i mean are you saying that you will write all those formulas as a platinum or device function in your back end so thats when the user is asking for certain information you will pass on those bad data management  functions client im it doesnt run that query and send it to the fact table and the dimension and get the number or you want to read it from what the front end issales engineer so we would so thats basically the part that we define and step four which is defining goes no calculation formulas that you need for these type of things that youve described because they may be level specific then theyd be combination specific right,0.8495,0.079,0.028,0.893
med,lost,company product, data management  functions ends sales engineer so some of them can be generalized some main require you to have very specific performance which are just very specific to a particular something right so for example your drug versus someone that says market shift change that mounts specified a very particular thing in that calculation you define that and step four which i havent gift company i wanted to do here lets just say nope youve got this i can i can just search but the the problem with or you know the fact that you can search and all of this happened like i can i am getting all of these does that how did that come through and dynamically generating sequel sequel those things happen onboarding process sales engineer but for a business user adoption to be useful the kinds of things that youre talking about and bought that spot talk about whats really important so keep those questions in your success criteria right is that i want calls per day at the site that is a calculation onboarding process ends sales engineer were gonna have variants of that that you know maybe theres a breadth and depth calculation i dont know what those kinds of things very standard elegantremoved   removed yeah ive already completed yeah okayclientsales engineerclientsales engineer right and that is back you know they used to do that with third party vendor is webex yep great solutions i mean im calling me back third party vendor i know those things right complex calculations we do this and we do this very well and thats why i feel very confident in it but you have to of course learned to believe that with your own data and and your own experiences so lets get this yeah so i established okay i have this data i can actually use them in in my calculation so what im gonna do now is im gonna say hey lets define a sales experience a search expenses would be called is defining a worksheet right and then the book sheet im gonna select my tables so users your point you know we can actually make sure that im not just bringing everything in the user gets lost or defining specific calculation with selling theme of which all of those pieces that i can define these i can say hey from my fact people im gonna use i can price lets say that that could be and the quantity put his i this is retail sales but you will have an rx trx samples this them together right hi this is hello developer theclientsales engineerclient  you in yet on that end user doingsales engineer hello hello side of the house yeah and so i can always call us today lets go this is price you know see as i leave it at that and i just bought this this transaction lets say you know i i have the name of it i can rename them i could rename them at the table level to any anything above that and edit it i can also go and say hey i want to store state zip code and maybe the name and the city in in my analysis so all of those bases and same thing with the product catalog feed i want the product so far its just simply select but coming back to your question earlier what if i wanted it to be more complicated calculations but then i dont want every user to but its there for them to dynamically place as a search search themremoved   removedthis is where we support lots of really complex calculations different ways group aggregate i bring that up is is an interesting way to do this because you can allow them to say hey i want to calculate you know for example some at at at a certain level at a certain level of filtering right so these are the nuances like become really important to calculate the denominator goes off of breadth and depth or you know contribution analysis or market share analysis which we become it could be conditional calculation that would be level based calculations you really bringing in different things in there and it also could be things coming from one table that could be coming from multiple pages rightclient  hi level we like their name their logic rightsales engineer yeah basically the rights that logic for you let me just make sure making sure youve got that logic right so when we do our requirements with you for a production roll out even ask you like hey by the way tennis multiple of these calculations so that we dont incorrectly put the wrong thing okay and its can you process and put it in the database tables show you can but my family like you said some things are gonna matter based upon the type of analysis youre doing and you want them to be dynamic right anyway so this becomes my my demo worksheet right and this is what i would share it with someone okay by the way in the demo worksheet as well if i wanted some you know do innovation and things like that or sales sales is unsupported revenue right you make rx alright you know something i thought the script something like that all of those right different names that you might have right data drill down sales engineer i can put that down let me see if a state i want to just hey as i look at this i want states to actually use the y d but so i can actually do that at that level and see if that and so now as i go in and i have this view this is what im gonna see i give two users right data drill down ends sales engineer so im gonna i can share it with whoever needs to consume this thing so again all of this member the persona name is the

med,lost,onboarding,account executive once we have necessary approvals theyll be a couple of things naturally they need to have it in here by pending we have these case good to go we can set up that connection to third party vendor spin up a company cloud instance and essentially begin building out the search experience for your business users onboarding process account executive and its very similar to the process just walkthrough at this point what will wanna do is set up sessions with your test users so i we recommend usually anywhere between five and  i think thats a sweet spot number to have a big enough pool size to really get valuable insights from them as to how this could help improve their day to day and what we do throughout the two week proof of concept is very much hands on guided workshops office hours with sales engineer onboarding process ends account executive so that its not like take software and run see how it works for you but its very much working with them to ensure they understand how company works and we can really make sure they get everything they need to make this a successclient so how do we get a hands on with company against real data i dont see the infrastructure stuff andaccount executive action please zero to search is one that would happen so we connect to the data we build out the search experience and that would be with your team not with our users right its tracked so itclientaccount executiveremoved   removedsales engineer wouldnt be more with the developer the people who understand the data data management  functions sales engineer so that that step is more with people who understand the data and the plumbing so shelly is probably someone on your team who at the yeah those definitions that was familiar with the definitions and say yes thats a represent data calculation that is a complex one night and so people can get a feel of that data management  functions ends client yeah so you also will have to rename some of that table names and column names right what what exists today yeah sosales engineer we have a noise from a business perspective right thats why i think its important to understandclient yeah i think that that time required from this team will depend on how much you want to customize your back end to make it onboarding process client a front end really isnt it so it might take like depending on the subject area it may take a week it might take a month to build on dictionary isnt itsales engineer yeah and again i think would be tried to make sure we understand too that whole success criteria part of it right industry issues sales engineer is there are there is a type of calculation we are doing that same calculation is going to manifest itself five different end in five different things but its the same time right so it doesnt mean that we necessarily need to build every fiveremoved   removedcombination of it right we build one or maybe two of the types of its enough for the business users to get a sense of what theyre trying to do industry issues ends sales engineer were not trying to build the whole application youre trying to build the content the pieces of it that makes sense for you to give you enough comfort to say yes i can make the leap of faithclient yeah i understand yeah i mean basically we might have to pick one subject area and then x number of kpis within that subject area but still havent even if you have to take one subject area for one brand say  to  kpis what are they say definitely defer to yeah the back end ready this is thesales engineerclientsales engineer spot is really you know so i think it happened theres theres a little bit of step in between the big block of zero to search workshop to a test user people yeah hiclientsales engineer this is to establish connectivity hey weve gotten weve got the tables or everything you need,0.9961,0.111,0.015,0.874

med,lost,onboarding, onboarding process sales engineer that client and client i think the point i would like to make us you know this is sort of the big milestone that he if he cant even connect to your environment and establish connectivity we we know we havent hit the main part right and so before we get to the test yes it does absolutely more work to be done and that were gonna need someone on your team to at least walkthrough and say hey these are the calculations i do right and this is the nuance it on deployment options clientremoved   removed yeah yeah one quick question so typically for any other client video going up youll see it on your cloud right so did they go through any assessment of your infrastructure because here if we have to move any data outside nor does internet they will be doing a third party assessment its quality bus yessales engineerclient and then only they will approve to move that do that outside unless we must have that done and then take it out otherwise they will not allow any data to load unless they approved the destination infrastructureaccount executive sales engineer i would almost look for your guidance here on what you think would be the easiest left for this teams and because we can it might make the review easier if you do install it in your third party vendor but i understand that requires more of it and his involvement versus company cloud will be faster from an it perspective bubble or require more of a reviewsales engineer yeah and so there are a couple of options that we could consider on back deployment options ends sales engineer i just look what the best option from a business use perspective is to make sure that its on your data its fun and games and it gets it is the real stuff right that way everyone sees that the next step is like okay that means i have to do xyz maybe a long list of things canaccount executivesales engineer you prove value and is it going to be valuable enough for you or them to make the leap of faith if it was abstracted data in this case the the student is less upfront but youre gonna have to go through that any way before production right,0.992,0.117,0.003,0.88
med,lost,next steps,client so guys im im sorry ive gotta cut us a little bit shortremoved   removed agenda client im getting thing for my next meeting but i i do i wanna make sure that we can walk away from here with what are what the concrete next steps are so maybe from you know to prepare the use cases what we could do is come up with maybe like you know   questions that that we would want to be able to ask of company and have company be able to answer agenda ends client and theyre not going to be no brainers right its its not gonna be you know what were our sales and city last month its right there you know theyre going to get into some of the some of the business rule complexity that client was talking about onboarding process client and if if we could come up with that that list of questions not thinking about the data but thinking about the questions then we could map it back to the data and think about what data we need to be able to answer it and then like maybe that defines what we want to have in the scope of the proof of concept onboarding process ends client i think that you know theyre honestly like we may be several steps away when when you talk about like the you know doing something doing something onprem here or even involving it and doing this proof of concept i mean you know honestly like i think were probably talking about doing something in february right i dont want to wait for february to do a proof of concept i so i wanna i wanna move quickly i think that as you know i know it might sound crazy but the tpa process and the and the the the info sec process which normally might take a really long time i think might be quicker than its getting people from my team who are ready to stand up and and be our partners in this so well well get that going on on our end you know well start asking those questions and see what would be necessary we might be able to do something you know for the proof of concept maybe we can do some degree of like well just stripped certain data out of it so we dont have to worry about it you know so were looking at real data but we dont have real names or something like that yeah so let let us explore that on our end and for you guys if you could just let us know like what what is our what whats our next conversation next steps removed   removedclient whats the next thing that we need to do yeah that would be helpful okay i i really do want to move this forward im sorry ive gotta runaccount executive for sure ill send over a follow up with the outlines of the use case documentation and well well schedule time with suggested next steps perfect okay thanks client thanks yeah,0.9982,0.182,0.024,0.795
med,won,small talk,sales engineer  right we can get going so client  i think we can we can get started with the the heavy lifting the last session right i think if you ever doing okay with that i think if we can if you can get to start sharing your screen i think we can get stuck with client,0.4019,0.083,0.035,0.882
med,won,demo, yes so this yes yes okay let me share my screen client  and so i dont i dont feel free to jump in if im you know its something we are i mean going into different direction with that the defense score for that thank you for that i think well be okay we can sure  data management  functions  client yeah client  okay so before that i just want to tell you like what i did and and up on the worksheet which recreated on last week okay so so this is the recent be i need that so i dont know shot okay so based on this ill put all the tables and defined necessarily joins okay so probably in later point of time myself and southern and read those joints and then relationship among those tables and i read if any if required okay so this is the worksheet so so these are the giants how you defined and i pulled all the necessary tables so only one table is missing that i reset the chat on unlimited youd say so i just pull all the tables and defense intelligence but i didnt include all the columns okay so whenever required we can add and then we can move on and the latter part we louder all the columns that correctremoved    removed data management  functions ends  client  okay so i was while i was doing this one right i got some couple of clarification and then ill show you yeah low boats okay how i did that labels and then we can move forward from there okay so ill just show you too bye client  so this is for the first two inside right so so theyre saying i interface that brings takes more than  hours to confirm okay so based on the event type three and five using the one big time so i calculate the difference between the event date time from event type equals three to even type equal to five okay difference of this date time i can work within two hours okay difference and i was so that is a function called different than ours account executive  hello client  i couldnt dedicate okay so different than ours from based on that we can filter the data so i didnt add color or equal to  so of course if you want for  hours if you want someone central i was at the wall hours we can be frankly filter here okay thats very pleasing and this is the supplier and this is the p dot com okay so this data needs to be validated  pricing  client  we can talk about that later point so this is our new fall to facilitate okay first of the some player or will it takes more than  hours to confirm for you okay so given and thats im descending order so start from two point four seven k and it goes to one okay these are the supplier client okay hey this template is taking more than  hours client  more than  hours equal to  hours probably we can put a greater than  client okay okayremoved    removedclient  okay so if you want i can we can account executive  do that  pricing ends  sales engineer  name whats the best way to do greater than or equal to ours yeah you should be able to do that operator i think sometimes in the search bar yeah just making sure yep exactly it it ties it to the correct you know field that you want to filter on okay yeah and then as maybe you can see you can actually you know you can use that drop down you know that says played with the filter to you know like you said kind of grab a different subset but you guys client  yes sales engineer  right within the search bar right  pinboard  sales engineer  so either one and you know whatever is more natural and then when you tie that to a a live board that way you can you know have have something preset but also you know they can toggle it on the fly client  okay yeah okay so one one thing okay  data drill down  client  so when when it boot camp okay so this is the one we can pick the top  removed a pop up in or something like that we can be good sales engineer  yeah just type top  that top as a keyword so it could be any number right it can be top seven it could beremoved    removed yeah  pinboard  client sales engineer  right so youve probably seen that sales engineer  and then the advantage if you save this again to your to your live board or say that as an answer you know this is a you know this this isnt necessarily hard coated right this is going to send a fresh query every time someone opens that answer  data architecture  sales engineer  so theyll be able to get a you know a real time look at the data or is real time as your your cloud warehouse right client okay client  hi acquainted switching right i have a question right so how do i have better no respond to time where you know right now i know that it its not even now we need or something like that but you know what i pay induce it obviously will expert that are not on time should be more faster right so does that is something configuration can be done in company side or having yeah i configurable i mean high bandwidth battles and third party vendor which we will be sales engineer  yeah theres a couple of different ways you know you can kind of tune that that performance im the first and most effective is going to be on the cloud warehouse side you know since company is writing the sequel then passing it down to you know to third party vendor to execute just making sure that sized appropriately data management  functions  sales engineer removed    removed also you know all else being equal computed field you know like we have to do some sort of custom logic within company thats gonna take longer to return than something that already exists at the cloud warehouse so as much as you can do within third party vendor to you know define these columns you know within within the cloud warehouse thats you know that thats typically what we see is you know contributing most to performance,0.9994,0.178,0.022,0.8
med,won,demo, data architecture  sales engineer  i dont know if csm you have any other thoughts on maybe the company side or or other things youve seen with you know making customer successful csm  yeah i would say when we get into kind of performance enhancements its nine times out of  its something we control we can control on the third party vendor side rather than the the company side so one way that we can experiment and test this is to connect just like you had showed that query sequel thats the exact sequel that were sending down to third party vendor so you could copy and paste that in sequel or in third party vendor and see how fast that rounds and then we can see if thats something thats you know we need to do some some performance tuning on the on the third party vendor side or if it is going to be more in fact client  okay so obviously fixing what same time i think i think i think nothing wrong from company right so the wc a direct answer so if its i mean what are the acquisition time in third party vendor if its take more hidden company than i think we should something going does look like i think client  yeah so if i understand correctly you mean to say this calculation field should be government id but db level not at the third party vendor level theyre excited company one is that correct  data management  functions  sales engineer  i mean if possible you know i think all else being equal we typically see it is faster if its already defined in third party vendor that way company when its writing the query it it isnt you know having to do any of that calculation you know are writing an additional statement it can just fetch an existing column right data management  functions ends  sales engineer removed    removed so if possible you know maybe in production or you know later down the road if thats feasible thats something you know you could explore csm  yeah i would say for for the time being its its worthwhile to keep that in the back of our minds that that could be affecting performance thats kind of that would certainly be on the company side  data architecture  csm  but it also i think the first place to to look at the the warehouse performance and then you know we can take it steps gradually as if performance is and as snappy as we want it then we can do things like move those calculated fields just third party vendor client  okay okay okay so companies that do this yes so good yeah  pinboard  sales engineer  yeah i was just gonna say so if you want to save this you can you know you dont have to save over what you have or you can you know you can save it as a new a new visualization if you just click the pin icon or you can update it or you can close out and save gives you some flexibility  pinboard ends  sales engineer  so if you want to just add it to this one you can come back and delete the other one later or just override it client  i think its a greater than or equal to five eight one we saw that makes more sense right yeah sales engineer  okay so i think just if you click close itll prompt you in the top right client  yeah yes yes yes yeahremoved    removed yeah account executive csm  both both that update button does the same action as well client  okay okay so yep so this is one so so this this one and let me sales engineer  was this a second on our list client  no no no so is the fastest itself so i dont know i was saying about the software type okay eps are normally be us i think so i dont know this as far as a non abs id say dbs you can for that environment which type of pbs okay so if you click on go to build on i made it the last quarter which is the po number or something like that so that it will fetch that reseller for this particular cb a site okay so i dont wanna fire i created this abs hyphen software to have a separate dimension so that instead of you can play or you can use it whenever required okay client okay okay well this is i dont know whether im not part of my i may already be hello yes client  yes yes client okay so whether the cvs id only be either like manual people so in this heavy influence in calculating the click greater than  hours client  no i think we i tried pulling the confirm po usc equal to  hours for the greater than a week or two let me try that client  i tried with the equals  and it gives them a note that our time so okayclient removed    removed yeah i think we are only yes spm the eta your first week client too because you know this non abs will not have a you went to three client  okay client okay so thats what we need to make some some changes in and on like on the calculation of  hours  data management  functions  client  okay yeah okay okay okay so i just created as a separate dimension yet so that when our big query completely does a supplier type and if you want to yes we are the software type and then one more youd be estate so he this table view you a ba the other thing right  data management  functions ends  client  the other for you hey if spd and we have to be like this on the software type review whether its the easiest normally views if you want to see the southern you can see if you want to see it im a local number two you can use the client okay client  okay so from that you can throw down to so i suppose so this is ed fsb right so if you want to drill down to be your your number and you can do that let me see sales engineer  order number client  supplier nameremoved    removed global support yeah sales engineer client  yeah from that you can still source pbs type psp esp you will get the supplier the welcome  data management  functions  sales engineer  how many suppliers would you typically see here was it would this be in like the hundreds or thousands sales engineer  okay and then you can always flip it to that table view if you as you start to build out maybe like more of a report type answer client its multiple sales engineer  multiple columns multiple you know metrics multiple attributes  data management  functions ends  client  so you can move from glasgow good also gain it will get the baby sales engineer  a good question and csmed you know i believe that it only sends at once its just rendering it differently or i could be wrong csm  yeah thats good question i dont know if it does and a fresh query or not data drill down  client  okay so probably when we click on this we can send theremoved    removed yeah we can check huh account executive client  so these are the supplier with clio account and then come from few hours so we can change the visualization type currently it is and i think its in bubble chart right so we can change it in a different visualization aspect  data drill down ends  client  okay so this is a this is what i are completed so far okay so while doing this i got some cloud i need some more clarification as well okay so should i want to my clarification i just want to see something else right so i dont know client yeah we can,0.9998,0.206,0.017,0.777
med,won,demo, data management  functions  client  yeah okay csm  me so far so good goodness client  okay okay just save it i can account executive  wonderful client  what my costs clarification is account executive  just so sheclient removed    removed yeah my building worksheet right so i pay some couple of challenges okay so i couldnt be able to find like operator in company okay that is a condition bad client  i need to implement this condition so when the case statement this one case by default we could go on and this is the column in like possibly w the immediate so i need to implement i need to create on dimension using this condition using this case statement okay  data management  functions ends  client  i tried with the company i couldnt get him to get the like operator so after seeing the data for time being i use it at sub string to fetch the rows so but i need to know whether like operators are valuable or client not csm  okay i dont think we have the people like clause client  okay so so of course always such a thing right so so you need i need to mentioned begins with im this begins with like that csm  begins or contains theres a theres a few operators that we have so if you go to show assistance client  yeah so csm  yeah so client  so this campaigns right so this campaigns the w more so on notaccount executive removed    removed yeah client  so you you you our right so what im trying to say is client  so this is my condition so whenever if it is like a patented w almost zero percentage then i need to mentioned this as the vda will contains work similarly yeah csm  so contains i i think it will client  hello this is if if campaigns broomstick foot room we could do true okay okay right okay okay so in terms of like i can use campaigns correct yeah i can do that i will take it take that one okay and moreover when they see some documentation there are a statement like begins with stops with science with like that right but when i tried to type of begins with them than it is not it is giving somebody ever suppose let me create a new formula client  you for the so this one to start with a client  big things we try to be consistent so if i type like this if its not giving that begins with keyword but i can see in the documentation that is optional begins with csm  there is so go to show assistance again its gonna tell us what we need for begins to csm  it is not the text so it looks like client  withsales engineer removed    removed the keyword like within the search or is it available through the formula as well client  let me show you somewhere else yeah the corporate tutorial like and see client  sorry i think there are some options for getting the documentation edits afraid well lets see csm  yeah so question mark client  i didnt get the payment account executive  definitely yeah yeah one loss client  search for client  so it is there in the operators pharma or something that i saw csm  yeah im section here account executive  as well sales engineer  because i believe it its available through the search bar but client  easy search data you mean to say heysales engineer removed    removed rich data yes yes  okay okay client sales engineer  not positive that is available through the formula as well client  okay okay sales engineer  they call it something different sales engineer  but the the idea is that a user could come in there and just just type that on the fly like begins with client  okay client  yeah probably a correct sales engineer  if you if you go to search data begins with all the recognized sales engineer  ends with csm  yeah its a text keyword sales engineer  i think if you have like another field before that client  is it as aremoved    removed keyword  number sales engineer client account executive  yeah this global supplier name begins with client yeah or sales engineer  not begins with client okay sales engineer  and youd put the string in their client  the sales engineer  value yeah client  okay so it is available im not in the system so if csm  correct its a its a keyword but keywords or not available to be used in formulas  data management  functions  account executive  okay okay yeah okay soremoved    removed just clientclient  i try to contain some way miss this i didnt take this okay so okay so this is for clear like operators like im use campaigns okay so another thing is some software so of course if i i did join okay if i added join and i want the ability joining later so what happens if hes asking asking me to dialogue with the different things or into join me need that many and so sheets and i will send that so how do we delete the particular so samples hopefully added extra job okay so my question is like sales engineer  this to an exempt existing join client  yeah yes yes yes suppose if i need to add one more time column right so you say you need to delete this giant first and then you need to add a jar okay if i delete delete is showing all the dependency associated with this csm  so lets see here so scroll up just a little bit and  data management  functions ends  client  yeah csm  the pencil icon go ahead and select that client  so i think i think we need to remove the worksheet i guess csm  yeah we need to we need to do this on on the tape client  yeah got itremoved    removed okay let me one daughter account executive client  suppose this is okay so if i want to pilot this okay i think you can csm  you should be able to edit it here client  okay let me edited okay so so to say to change the column youll need the ability to csm  i see sales engineer  right because theyre not just changing the you know the join type or the card analogy here youre actually adding an additional client  hello so if we are in the initial phases and then if it is we can get it done and we can recreate it suppose when reordering later on we are many labels and media and associates oliver city when we tried to add or change any giant condition then hold on a video like it is showing we need to delete all the dependencies  data management  functions  csm  he client  is there a way we can do that so its supposed to let me i tried to delete this lets see whether account executive  anyclient removed    removed dependency so of course im building is see the same purchase order placement insight is i watch it has been used okay so when i click on this worksheet so i need to remove the table its certified i need to remove the columns from this list here  data management  functions ends  csm  you would need to remove the calm from this list here client  list okay so this removed damage remain safe csm  yeah well do any of these formulas use that that client  no current rate is not use csm  yeah then then all that will remain the same so if you get rid of that column then this will no longer be this worksheet will no longer be dependent on that client  okay okay fine so if i say i suppose im delivering

med,won,deployment options,client  so its not like a typically a lot of the debit databases that have this not the admin for setup tables its in third party vendor only the process of processing speed or the capacity of the services which will process the queries right so so thats the main bank and they say for a while logging with third party vendor browser that default barrows could be different but for the beatles like microstrategy or third party vendor or company the the expert that battle side the process or should be different right  data architecture ends  client  so but i think the adoption is we are not able to enforce from company were losing the odd however we know that we are able to enforced through that that that we support so thats the only difference csm  yeah csm  let me just take that down as a as an action item client  yeah maybe you can proceed for the next one going this year client  yeah okay so whenever i run any and so shes site so i am back in it is running for only one month and then the recording fees okay saying that the query time though okay so heres some things setting is given at the company level  data transfer  client  let me see so are the same the connection so if anything it will only one monetate is exhibiting after one minute it is getting failed saying that the code editor query time okay okay so i just want to know that this is for any settings have only been in company state to the state it can run five minutes or soremoved    removed done do you know  answer  deployment options  csm client sales engineer  no you can set a flags within our software version im not sure about cloud but i think the default is is a minute csm  so i know there we can certainly we can we can increase that time out threshold on cloud client  okay csm  so similar to name similar how we have it with software we can do that with our cloud version today and that would go through me  deployment options ends  csm  so i would just need to know and understand what you want the thresholds be setup going forward client okay client  currently that finance projects and and running i think that that should be some sort of straight i think its not the application we saw i know that there are already some projects but booker and separation not losing a plate yeah so they do have some pay more because like this are im just curious like whether the payments i think will be set up in the application commonplace rx and specific to connection or something,0.915,0.106,0.07,0.824
med,won,deployment options,removed    removedcsm  no its its specific its for the entire application so it would it would affect the the finance the cap x he would increase the time up for them as well client  okay sales engineer  so we could increase it to you know two minutes  seconds you know but it would have to be for the full deployment  data architecture  sales engineer  you know most query should be snappy but i think there are some cases where you know that that speed benefit might not outweigh the cost within third party vendor you know so theres trade offs there sales engineer  but yeah if theres anything we can do it is there a specific query that youre noticing that is taking longer than a minute currently that we can you know maybe help you know advise on again things on the third party vendor side or if theres anything we can do differently within company  data architecture ends  client  okay okay so even this first one right so what are the this one right so sometimes its most of them its funding but i can see sometime its saying is query time or better csm  yeah thats sales engineer  what the greater than  hours client  yes yes,0.9911,0.194,0.007,0.799
med,won,demo, data management  functions  removed    removed and its its client sales engineer  mostly with with that a calculated field client  hello sales engineer  yeah is that something that you know i guess i think weve mentioned before is that something you could define at the third party vendor level its just a separate column client  so we need to create that view or aggregation table on top or aggregate view of  data management  functions ends  client  on top of that existing account executive  new client  well currently that we that is not in our school client  you how our that our office more product go on one so we we cannot do i mean either developments are changes so thats a thats a tricky part right so even but other be application they didnt microstrategy or third party vendor this kind of of qualification or something like that we we are currently handling into be laid itself so i think there are some options to do it in company layer itself that would be great otherwise what will happen is like there could be a mix of scenarios may come up like the site industry issues  client removed    removed so every time we may end up doing the doing that team requesting and it may take longer turnaround time later but obviously this this will not be waiting so much time to have that done in the back and say thing too sales engineer  that makes sense that makes sense yeah i mean i mean im wondering if just the the the calculation itself here is you know its yeah executing inefficiently are things we can you know further do here  industry issues ends  csm  yeah because lets lets go back to this and company so lets go ahead and then just edit or copying it  data management  functions  csm  either way lets go to our i and lets look at the query visualize or yeah so scroll down there query visualize or and so lets see here csm  so so left outer and its just these two tables okay csm  and so we have our worksheet filter csm  confirm csm  and so for this we would absolutely need this left out or join  data management  functions ends  sales engineer  because were switching the supplier name to all the po informationclient removed    removed yeah it could be let me check with the southern amount so okay so what type of trends so we need to provide so in this case supplier name and then we picking practice we need to equal january because we are joining its updated quote and then thing  data management  functions  client  but in for other analysis you could join me not gonna work okay so you either have lift up again i write auto zone something could work client  site on you so youre client yeah yeah yeah im seeing joined the columns company id equal to a software called able to company id is this something im doing wrong  data management  functions ends  client  probably i would have taken the let me check that while we won client  he is account executive  some joins client by any chance can be able to download this right say though you have a picture kind of thing client  yeah yeah i even that that is also my costing a sudden because this if if a dollar amount will be clearly visible like we can see it right about company  clientremoved    removed yeah client  i just can mentioned company the company id itemize client company become third party vendor okay okay companies you completely client  something so bad that join is coming  about company ends  client  view the ones on the global software name client come from you or you want to send me some super client  im sure so few events on some super modern he what he wants on some super him this is the condition so it is mentioned as company the company the item item management software the call this is correct it is really like to see it  data management  functions  client  break any idea about this sales engineer  sorry what the issue is the the ui is displaying client  trying to see yeah you join columbus mentioned company put the item software recording for the company like this the different sort of start correct one between the sample for name emphasis people even exist so when they check the people you want this table joins so i can see central for example this is the one so name correctly on the different correctsales engineer removed    removed i see what is the query itself sure i dont think we would click close and the sequel client  so it is showing correctly  data management  functions ends  sales engineer  okay interesting i havent come across that well it looks like i mean this is what third party vendor is actually process client yeah client  yeah sales engineer  interesting client  but here in accordingly for laser trying to something like a different rate sales engineer  yeah interesting cool well well well take that down it doesnt look like its impacting the you know performance and whats being generated but it is an interesting yeah yeah i havent quite seen that client  okay sales engineer  all take ill take note of that client  okaysales engineer removed    removed and then if theres anything else we can think of on our side you know that we can enhance this particular question would you would you mind pasting the formula that is used if you click close and the i think its the confirm po hours youve defined that at the worksheet right sales engineer  if you could just yeah maybe paste that within the chat and we can see if theres yeah okay client  so return what is sales engineer  okay and then the underlying mean okay client  so i outlet or two columns and then from the different service okay sales engineer  yeah so that shouldnt be an issue but maybe this first one can see this is just if event type okay what was the one you know last week that we had to apply that the sequel pass through function the csms client  hi this is this is the one the one type this is the one sequel  pricing  sales engineer  okay okay client  so i cannot at this fee and then five got minimum for the event type equals three and many of them for even pay people to five and then im surprised this tool to get the console pos difference difference in ours got i mean you wont be on timeframe pricing ends  sales engineer removed    removed i was just seeing if theres anything that jumped out as you know you know unnecessary or yeah that looks pretty pretty concise account executive or csm we can you know examined this a little more on our end and you know like you know if if if there is something we come up with or maybe the best course of action would be just define it you know within third party vendor and thats that would be the recommendation ,0.9996,0.181,0.021,0.798

med,won,small talk,client  awesome yeah hey guys so im client ive been at client for about six months and my background is in startups prior to this asset dollar shave club and i heard you mentioned the company employee  really client  early in have you heard of doc vacate or company employee  not but if if it does what i think it does which is sort of like brokers the back and forth of managing dogs what people actually go on vacation yeah client  yeah that was that was what we that was what we did it was instead of taking it back to the kennel you find someone who you can pay to watch the dog and in their home and so the dog gets to vacate you get to vacate we got acquired by roverremoved    removeddotcom so dog make hey is no longer but if youve heard of rover dotcom we live within within them yeah account executive  yeah we view ive used for over a couple of times like in the past three months so yeah its good its its worked out for me yeah because i dont know a ton of people in the area and i was sitting here so yeah client  thats really it i like some of the other dog services like wag and some of the other ones that ended up getting like a pretty bad reputation for just having low quality like you know anyone like not anyone can enter your house and properly leash up your dog and walk your dog  small talk ends  client  the the the folks who sign up on rover tend to be like really high quality of course theres reviews and all that kind of but yeah with even im in the process of adopting a dog and i will plan to have him get sat on rover account executive  thats awesome yeah okay well so i have an opportunity to talk with nametian on ad today and we actually we talked a couple of times because theyve expressed like a sense of urgency and and choosing the solution so i know you you kinda pointing them in our direction for the purposes of our conversation today i know we were speaking about internal before like are we still looking at that and then additionally looking at the embedded option client  no yeah so thats a thats a totally confuse things but nametian i have two totally different use cases although i guess you could argue that he and i are stakeholders that each others use case so so name im sure he walked you through it but name is trying to find like an external data reporting platform so like our brokers and and other folks employer groups et cetera and yeah theres definitely a sense of urgency for him because he he he has committed to standing up the first implementation of this in q so theres some urgency there and then but for me like my my main use case when you guys came across and like i said i wasnt really necessarily setting out to solve this problem but you guys came across my inbox i was intrigued my use cases for internal reporting and empowering the teams in particular the product management team but i suppose it could be anyone to to really be able too to look at into analyze our data more quickly fluidly i have about like one of  product managers who can write their own sequel but you know even if like as you guys know its not as good enough to just teach everyone how to write sequelremoved    removed,0.9982,0.181,0.038,0.781
med,won,customer base,client  like you have to be pretty pretty good to like understand our our table setup and you know you know being able to do joins and all that kind of stuff like i feel like at this point if they dont know sequel were better off just coming up with tool that they can use  data management  functions ends  client  but the the the you know the ones that know the sequel all are much better at like im gonna quickly run this im gonna quick look at this im going to quickly see this and our our business insights team sits within the the operations organization and so theres no theres no such thing as like let me pull a number this week to inform a decision im making on the platform its like get in line to get some sort of of like really highly produced published third party vendor dashboard theyre like isnt what we want right so two totally different use cases but i talked to you guys over to nametina for consideration on his use case because it obviously be a bit of an easier sell if we can use one tool to for both use cases  data architecture  company employee  right where where does your where does your data reside today client  well like we have them in in third party vendor company employee  its all pretty much okay client  yeah i didnt know if that was a trick question company employee  no i wanted to get an honest answer to the question that werent thing is is if youre familiar with the way company works where we we proxy if you will on top of these cloud data platforms in a way that allows users to come in that dont necessarily need to know sequel,0.9946,0.201,0.036,0.764
med,won,customer base,removed    removedcompany employee  certainly its an advantage to have that here that foundation like everything else but its certainly not required and the idea of understanding even if you know the sequel be i dont know how the tables are joined together  industry issues  company employee  youre still stuck trying to figure that out no key relationships and all that madness and that and stay static and third party vendor either so company capacity to sit on top of that data model habit view to the user in a way that is kind of in line with how they think about the questions they might ask of the data without doing a lot of work very quickly get into that view of i want to ask my my questions of the data and get my answers and then move on with my day not getting the queue is this to candidly not about the visualization thats our thats our value premise in the marketplace so we can yeah,0.8554,0.118,0.05,0.832
med,won,company product,client  thats i mean thats what piqued my interest when account executive first emailed me i hadnt heard of you guys but it seemed like it just seemed really like easy to get going and and really lightweight and you know even just since i chatted with account executive last like a bunch of use cases came up and you know im lucky because i have vp and my title i can ping krishna and hell run it for me real quick and send it back but thats not that doesnt scale company employee  yeah no it doesnt it doesnt for the people that are our vp and their title its a different world do you have a sense for how how much data is in your like in the universe of data that you would need to go and ask questions of you wouldnt have any idea what that volume of data might be client  no i dont know that would probably be a good question for name now ill ill tell you whats interesting though like it it doesnt need to be it it it i think its actually going to be at like what i would use we use it for i think is going to be a little bit more limited than than what you might think  industry issues  client  and and what i mean by that is like if you take our like our sign up funnel like our funnel is going to be like perfectly instrumented in in third party vendor by our bi teamremoved    removedlike the odds if we ever needing to do something in the funnel thats not handled by the bi team would be low right  industry issues ends  client  like the odds are theyre all over that the interesting thing about our our motto and then if you think about like our member data thats all theres tons of privacy laws with hippa and all that kind of stuff so like were not allowed to query and production things really related that could return like medically sensitive results for example the interesting thing about our model is that we want to be the leader in cash price healthcare and with all this transparency these transparency laws that are coming out like when  hits and doctors are all required by law to publish their cash prices like were already robbing the seo engines  data management  functions  client  so that like we are like the leader of that and where im running into a lot of trouble is like in in like in third party vendor we have we have we are going to start aggregating like tons and tons and tons and tons of data sources and theres no good way for me to make sense of like of  data management  functions ends  client  like so ill just throw out like a couple of examples like how many providers in city do i have a cash price for how many how many you know i mean thats thats really the main one right is for me to start digging in on there you could slice our data a remove different ways,0.9982,0.211,0.055,0.734
med,won,company product,client  and the way that i would want to look at it would never match like what were doing with it on on the front end and so that thats like like a tool for me to be able to make sense of like all of this what we would consider like provider data is this sort of like my my driving use case but even if i told you how much data we had today it wouldnt even matter because over the next two months were integrating with like to a new data sources and then we need to get more data sources company employee  yep okay yeah the reason i ask is sometimes we got a couple of different ways that we can price in the marketplaceremoved    removed deployment options  company employee  and one of them one of them is based on capacity so there are some customers that have a very its ironic were actually talking to another healthcare startups very much hippa data theyre bringing psychiatry us into a network to serve people and not have to manage practices  deployment options ends  company employee  so as a clinician you just want to help people you dont want to be managing a business and running a bnl and all the other shit that you have to do so theyre moving that that that function there dataset for the time being is again its a subset  pricing  company employee  its not all the hippa data its contained its about  remove rows and theyre not doing anything beyond that yet yeah were just looking at that say thats our universe we know what were gonna need for that and they can they can really walks in their their their spend quite easily  data management  functions  company employee  another side is more aligned with where where youre probably going to be which is i might have i might want to employ a bunch of the data from the third party vendor data marketplace i might wanna overlay that kind of information with what were what were collecting on the providers to give me clarity  data management  functions ends  company employee  but what we might wanna do for our offerings in the city state southwest marketplace told the marketplace all of that kind of stuff that conditional back and forth yeah is typically handled with our consumption model which is again a credits based approach ties to users like yourself based on how much time youre youre you know in interrogating data and thats how that works data architecture  company employee removed    removed and that that tends to be when you dont know what the data is or you know that its really big thats the thats the easy button to getting started with company okay okay client  yep that makes company employee  sense  data architecture ends  company employee  and you dont have to worry about the data set sizes and you can do whatever you want with the third party vendor marketplace data which i think is is often exactly what we want with this this sort of pay or management healthcare revenue management as a use case weve been around a lot in this space,0.9855,0.102,0.044,0.854
med,won,customer base,company employee  so we have a lot of experience in that there are a lot of companies that have popped up to specifically help companies solve for this problem so i think its great i just as a point of interest as a removed here this model are you kind of taking an economics based view of the healthcare payer relationship  about company ends  client  yes i guess what do you mean when you say economics space view company employee  so im presuming that your ability to to put plans in front of people to have them go and then theres some back end that doesnt match with the front end right theyre gonna pay a certain amount for a procedure or a an event medical that on the back end are you doing stuff directly with the with the healthcare providers are with the payers himself client  yeah so whats interesting is so the when you walk into the most doctors offices or even if you go to the hospital you might notice but if you tell them youre paying cash you get a better price than what they csm your insurance and so we dont give you an insurance card like a traditional model we give you a debit cardremoved    removedand we tell you to tell your doctor youre paying cash and then whats really different about us is we have a fixed benefit amounts and so if you our goal is to build a tool that is so powerful if you need to get a physical you go on and you say im in city i want to get a physical and you can see all the doctors in manhattan beach that have physicals and how much they charge,0.9798,0.115,0.01,0.874
med,won,pricing,client  now if your benefit amount for physical  bucks and our model if you go to a doctor that charges  we give you the  bucks back and if you want to go to someone who charges  then you pay  dollar difference  pricing ends  company employee  yeah client  yeah so we dont theres no notion of like coinsurance theres no notion of of anything its like heres how much we give you for every single service and then you get to keep the difference if youre a smart if youre smart shopper emergencies or handle a little bit differently  pricing  client  so thats the idea we had someone last year who made  removed on our platform but just being smart and thats not going to be everybody most people arent gonna turn this into a game but because of the fact that weve taken out all the blow in the system our premiums are  percent less than the big guys company employee  so at some level though youre building out and economic probably regionally economic value model for procedure by cost structure its a little like japans model where they have the entire country done in the the cost of a m our eyes  removed client  yes yes so we we dont have a network,0.9754,0.148,0.019,0.833
med,won,customer base,  removed you can go to any doctor you want and in fact if you wanted to be a medical traveler and go to to youll want to get something done and really make some money that you could toys yeah some people dont know sounds good and nothing wrong with that services outside of the country but yeah its no its no problem from our perspective now what we are doing is we are going out and and creating partnerships not a provider network but lets say we partnered with im not saying were partnering with them but like a one medical or something where most of these big providers weve talked to in exchange for being promoted on our site are willing to offer our members prices for less than the benefit amount so its kind of like a guaranteed earning for the number and then what will the reason the providers like it is they dont have to deal with insurance companies we dont have any of these stupid rolls like you have to try this this before you can try this and we pay them on the spot they dont have to have it with an insurance company or wait   days to get paid company employee  fantastic i love this i love this job we we get and you obviously do could you do this for a living in many many places we get them involved in such such innovation its amazing perfect so i guess the question is how many folks do you think might be like yourself looking to use the the like a platform like company to go in and ask a bunch of questions a day client  yeah wed probably be start i mean as you can imagine were were growing like crazy would probably be starting with about  is is where id be thinking we would be starting company employee  so presuming that that that is not solving for is the nametmas client  yeah i know that doesnt solve for nametian and nametian his use case could have so many users company employee  is it the same is it the same data set though that that would be company employee editors different definitely different okay fair enough i mean what so what are you looking to do right now client are you looking to make a decision quickly on a tool youre looking to try real quickly what how we might work client  yeah so my like i would love to try it if and i dont know what you guys talked about with nametian if he was gonna try to but look to try it im totally fine with nametian i using the same data set theres absolutely no reason we need to try to do like two different trials right i think ill get the sense of it regardless of what testremoved    removeddata we load in but i know account executive said you know weve got like there is some work upfront to do some mappings and things to make it the tests realistic so to save time if we did it where where nametian and i like both did a trial and we we we did a trial together like im totally fine with that im certainly not on the on the time line that that hes on and also im im sympathetic to the fact that i need him to get my child done and he doesnt need me to get his child company employee  yeah he has the keys that you so you so very much what i understand i would i would think the nametmas interest is probably a little bit more functional and technical and then particularly the the use case side im just guesstimating there but it absolutely can be done as one event and all of the things that nametian might care about in terms of how how this product might get embedded inside the the client user experience hed want to be able to try some of those elements out that wont be particularly important to you because youll be logging into look at your data,0.9989,0.187,0.042,0.771

med,won,about company,company employee  yeah yeah what weve seen some folks like anthem do and others that are using company is theyre taking care of all the security around data in third party vendor in their case at the third party vendor levelremoved    removed data architecture ends  company employee  so its fully its fully masked out and on the company side if you decided to do this new have total control over you can have a view of that data that does have the claim information never any other relationships are able to be established between claimant claim and payment right yeah none of that stuff is as possible but then theyre looking at the sort of quick twist in the context of their analysis to to look at claims by other so they could do the economic stuff that i think youre talking about as central to determine what is the the value of an mri in city like theres somebody drive to dallas because its  removed cheaper maybe they do client  yeah you know you met you bring up an interesting point were currently hiring a new head of claims and like i want to chat this use case for me now but i wouldnt be surprised if i had a claims would want to use something like company to get after our anonymize claim data  onboarding process  client  i mean theres so theres so many use like anyone who likes to kinda just get their hands dirty with the data but not wait for the bi team and i think i had a claims could be spent like another potential use case not the not the we dont even have this person yet but i could potentially being a use case down,0.9867,0.149,0.019,0.832
med,won,deployment options,company employee  its a big one we we actually started at anthem with the head of claims and they they decided that their priority was more important than the other priorities that were established in the data team yeah so they they moved up the cute pretty quickly we actually did our proof with them  data architecture  company employee  so not set the bar to hike we did our proof with them in  minutes we have been connected to over  rows of data inside the third party vendor warehouse and were records that they hadnt been able to run in two years so we did a full that full hour and anthem employee was creating a search on a data set that theyve never been able to get in one sort of of view because the data was too big and the tables are too complicated right data architecture ends  removed    removedcompany employee  really wasnt that complicated in the back end it was just a horse power required do what they were trying to do yeah wasnt nobody has the time to figure it out right so wed love the opportunity to do that with with with you and nametian and the team and when the claims person comes on board they can take a look to client  awesome company employee  yeah account executive  so client it sounds like from your perspective like it makes sense to work with nametian on an ad to to set up the trial then or do you have the bandwidth right i know youre youre kinda swamped with the aca ohio stuff so do you feel like you have the bandwidth right now to to be able to kind of jump in and explore and and be a part of that client  yeah i would just bring in i have to team members one one name lauren and one named jeff and i would leverage them quite a bit to assist but yeah i think i have the bandwidth like especially if like especially if its not a large left on my plate to get it setup and i and i can just start playing around but if if like if there needs to be any product support i can loop in jeff or laura and they both got hired about a month ago and have have plenty of bandwidth that they could use so they would probably be my team to help evaluate if this would be useful neither of them no sequel either so well we can see whatever it yeah,0.9944,0.14,0.0,0.86
med,won,next steps,company employee  perfect do you have do you have a data i mean it sounds like nametina might own that butter is their data or data tables in third party vendor that that you would be comfortable being the the the test bed if you will for connecting client  yeah i just need to go next steps  client removed    removed let me see he like yeah like for sure because all week i have in port nametian ive been hey can you can you send me this table can you send me an ex this table all week all week ive been getting it so yeah like theres one here,0.9766,0.231,0.0,0.769
med,won,next steps, im looking at where its its we call it our taxonomy table and and i want i want access to the taxonomy table company employee  what is the taxonomy table client  this one i mean theres more than one table i would like the one where i was like hey can you just send me a screenshot like hes been sending me a screenshot so its really embarrassing it maps doctor mp eyes and and npi specialties to client specialties company employee  got it so its a bit of a reference table that says this is what the doctors call it this is what we client  yeah but like i literally couldnt do my job without this is sending me screenshots of the results because the the data sets to large like send us an excel so then just sending me screenshots its really embarrassing that ive got this far in my career and im asking for screenshots of this but here we are company employee  what it would be embarrassing if the data volumes and complexity had stayed static for the last  years but since the beginning of this call so its not embarrassing at all its pretty much typical cool alright so account executive think you have what you need in terms of who we should work with next and try to get this get this moved account executive  yeah i think so i will put something together for nametian on add and then ill ill include you on that to client and then it sounds like they i mean when i first spoke to them they told me their timeline was wed like to make a decision by you know next week so thats thats super quick so well see if we can get them set up really quickly get them up and running i think probably like an nda needs to be signed on your end right were stillremoved    removed startup be im like  i work for you guys client account executive client  finance yeah i thought ways to get an nda yeah let me yeah thats a good idea yeah yeah that sounds good yeah i was in north account executive but i mean obviously i think you wanna work towards nametmas time line if thats what he told you i dont see a world where they make a decision next week but well see company employee  presumed that the world does go that way okay we can meet that timeline the worst that we do is is accelerate to give nametian and company a different view of the world and the one they might naturally fall back to which is probably to go ahead with try to embed to third party vendor while worth our investment in in helping you see the other side client  okay so is that what did they tell you that that there can i didnt even think embedding third party vendor is on the table is enough company employee  always just default to the whatever the current tool sets are and its usually third party vendor or third party vendor client  yeah thats our current tool i have no interest in embedding that as our as our end cool company employee  thats client  not a thats not in the consideration set but company employee  okay fair enoughremoved    removedcompany employee  and and youll be the beneficiary of that embedded play from our behalf because it will unlock the enterprise functionality that you would use for client  nice okay cool when we do when we get to i know were not at the pricing stage it but when,0.9984,0.198,0.044,0.757

med,won,demo,client  yes thats right she asked me to do it then yeah i think with then we should have everyone else okay no good just i dont know and make sure its going to be joining things hey yeah i would be useful but let me just repeat it hello alright thanks okay name yeah we can we can continue working company employee  okay perfect so im actually just going to pass this over to company employee so today we are talking about security controls and embrace workflow so hill guide you through that and likely ask someone on the client side if you wouldnt mind sharing your screen and we can kind of run through the best practices with you company employee  thank you so yes whoever is client  or i company employee  guess nominated company administrator or the one that will be creating users and groups and and we we actually ended with that last time and connect to your data sources and build the worksheets and share them out to various users and either update or view privileges please stay on client  hello can i can do that let me share my screenremoved    removed let me know when you can see it client client  so lets go back to the admin page and look at our users and group where we let ended company employee  last time i think were were going to funnel down to three types of users administrators power users and general users if you click on groups client  wow company employee  so i guess that means that were gonna eliminate your client  another user company employee  names company employee  client renewals spo is that our path client  yes so if i remove this group or eliminate the school the users will still be there even if they have like for example if every user thats common between the three i think it was it was to keep up with the group will be eliminated right company employee  but the great yeah the grid pillages would be taken away from the user maybe just client  forcompany employee removed    removed process and control you may want to get the users out of the group first before you delete that group client  feel comfortable company employee  that that everyone is in a play client  where theyre supposed to be company employee  if theyre not theyll come talk to you theyll come to you soon enough client  so just so so we i just the clarification from my side stray and read a like so like i know we have something already kind of built in and stuff but then like in the previous call we were talking about admin super users and then all others so and then read it was gonna be like he would be the administrator so is this something like for roles and responsibility side you know is of trail where youre cleaning it up and stuff because you already some stuff built into you would need to reassign the access for those users for your reports and then from then on read it will take that role on or how did you just so we dont get any confusion yeah client  yeah and i think im gone i mean ive created these groups like month or two ago member how you know what assignments today probably yeah i provider i feel like i gotta go back to each user individually user check client  yeah company employee  best practice so client  yeah so maybe what it would be good is like the two of you have because youve already like started moving a lot of you know some of the navigation type stuff and readers starting out right reader thats would that be correct statementremoved    removed yeah  yes yes client client client  so yeah so maybe the two of you because just so were both on baby that example company employee  please keep that page up good im sorry finish your thoughts and then well talk about this user in particular client  okay yeah so that yeah i was just thinking of you know making sure that read is up to speed where you are austria and then and then do the transfer of the role youll have the you know role and responsibility client  right company employee do we need to do all of it right now i was thinking maybe we can take an example like for example i have this user no which we could probably i could probably you know i think this is the way i should be doing i could remove him from these groups and add them to one company employee  yes client  so i could probably just add them as an add list updated and do the same for all the users and make sure that they are assigned to a particular group and then sort of eliminate the groups that i dont need company employee  yes that would be perfect path forward and know you can sunset the the group over time no need to delete it today and just be sure that you you know where your users are and what privileges or giving them client  rightremoved    removedcompany employee  yep now again from a grouping mechanism you you you you have those other three to know what organizations are part of that could play a role into role level security but i heard that you probably are not meeting to apply real level security and what i mean do i need to explain role level security  customer base  client  yes client  if you could yes client  so what client  do it role level company employee  security best the end of the demonstration we do internally is say i say client  youre youre part of a sales region company employee  the south you cant see the north so therefore you belong to a group called south sales and and when you look at the sales data you only can see self sales and then correspondingly the people in north like to see the north,0.9997,0.219,0.01,0.771
med,won,demo,company employee  but of course if your executive you can see over the top of all of it so thats the idea of what youre doing is youre applying a filter rule on top of a data set that contains data that you are not privileged to see you can also do the same thing with worksheets and were going to go there and a little bitclient removed    removed so in other approach is through worksheets you got to individual worksheets and filter company employee  well your choice but do you think you see a use case where you will want to filter data in a client  table client  im sorry client  no i mean i dont think so were not and tray correct me if im wrong but were not dealing with like sales organization right  customer base  client  i mean right here this is for marketing so they should have visibility to to like all area were not dividing it by regions like somebody whos working west coast versus east coast versus you know country the the only thing i could see is we do have some data and snow like that sensitive that we wouldnt want everybody to be able to view  customer base ends  client  only specific individuals can have access to it so i dont know if thats the same thing so like yeah we have some like financial and credit data that not everybody is per like they dont have privileges to see that so would that be something that we would use it for company employee  maybe so if you have it that lets take what you have now so if you have a data set of i dont know type lets call it s p po and renewals two kinds of renewals and if you have that instead of renewals and they had a column and then they had the value of renewals that they have or the value of sco and you wanted to only show certain people spo data versus renewals data then you would use our alerts real level security to do thatclient removed    removed yeah then then yes we would we would want to do that okay company employee  so then going back to these groups as they stand now client renewables spo may or may not participate in a row level security algorithm and if they dont then you can delete it if they are going to be use then keep it and you can then start to sub divide your user groups into those users into those groups for the purposes of role level security if theyre not going to be is get rid of the groups eventually but then youll be creating groups for role level security in the future as you begin to capture those use cases and we can show you how to do all security if we have data available pretty simple i also going to send you the documentation on how to do it its really all it is is youre using an internal function and either cs group or user to determine who i am as im navigating and that filter condition follows me wherever i go so that wear claws and the sequel essentially will say show me data where ts group equals x and that x is your group that you belong to client  okay ill company employee  put it on my list that send that documentation client  yeah that would be company employee  right client  yeah what do you walk us through what are some of the privileges for like more than privileges i think what is something that an analyst may not be able too tool but not not need to manage again client  okay lets open up company employee  the manager group and they are your privileges traditionally so actually maybe we start least privileged to go to general user lets go to the general user group which i guess youre calling analystcompany employee  so at least privilege herecompany employee right now youre providing the ability to upload data which is do you want to give that to everybody youll have to ask yourself that thats the ability to upload well were on cloud i guesscompany employee yeah thats its right now its a legacy permission carry overcompany employee and so this cloud allowing them to upload would have to no not not at the momentcompany employeecompany employee okay so maybe that permission is irrelevant at this point so is that a is that a feature that you were looking to do data transfer company employee and this is what this is the ability to upload a spreadsheet  megabytes or smaller and then interrogate that spreadsheet through searchclient rightclient  i mean maybe i think so yeah butcompany employeeclient i mean maybe not the variance to maybe somewhere down the line in the futureclientremoved  removeddownload did you say im sorrycompany employee  megabyte limit upload a spreadsheetclient upload okay i was thinking downloadcompany employeeso so right now for company cloud its not a feature thats enabled it is on the road map so the reason the permission is there is because company cloud is one of a couple variations of the software so at the moment its a its an irrelevant feature ill just ill call that out in the notes but just sort of keep posted on on the updates of the software of whats coming new and youll be able to sort of find out what it is comingclient so what are they were would it be uploaded whereas this data being uploaded to,0.979,0.097,0.065,0.838
med,won,demo,company employee i know why its on the road map for that for company cloud because its not as straightforward as our other software options so were were working on how that would work out okaycompany employee yeah i would say local theyd be lovely the cluster but since youre on file you dont have a cluster deployment options ends company employee so these per se things to go into a table youll have to when that feature thumbs theyre going to buy tell it where to put itclient yes so sure yeah you just may want to consider analyst maybe not you know doing uploading data maybe its a data management i dont know well well we should discuss that when whenever that you know can be discussed whenever thats availableremoved  removed right okay yeahclientcompany employee,0.9135,0.125,0.031,0.844
med,won,company product, and staying close to i would not stress enough changes are coming every month on the cloud and staying close to what features are coming in future releases is very important i said that last time you may be surprised with the big change so always stay close to release notes and understand whats coming onboarding process ends company employee so you can very your users as well okay next download this i think we have a removed limit on a download so this is the csm to download the results set into a spreadsheet and interrogate the offline i heard an interesting comment the other day from another training session that anytime anybody downloads data one of the engineer loses its wings so that was a great line because we dont want to download data we want you to stay in the tool do truly believe somebody might want to download into my spreadsheet and do additional analysis or do we want to keep them in the tool to do additional analysisclient so we do have some use cases with they provide an ability for customers to download you know essentially you know the list of customers from the segments that theyve created you know by filtering and stuff so i think i would want to give that ability but also we have you know an company the features to maybe download a snapshot does that also confidently say downloading that pinboard company employee explain more what download a snapshot means that point in timeclient the the visit the visualization of the chart that you know you could probably download thats not that that chart orcompany employee yes it saving a chart as a pdf i think is always available this is downloading the nameremoved  removed dataclientcompany employeeclientcompany employeeinto a spreadsheetokay okay okayclientcompany employee pinboard ends and again going back to that concept the least privilege if youre unsure dont give it to them and then have them come to you and ask for it and then you can slowly incrementally grow their privilege set and and train them on what that privilege really means okay no developer privilege is our developer feature a brand new i dont think your general users would be using that thats the ability to embedding into other web applications so we will probably not give that to anyone at this point if you are going to do embedding i would cry create a new user group called developer and give them that privilege share with all users a reason why thats there they can share within their user group by default but sharing with all users allows them to send it to the entire organization you may want to limit that depending on who is who are you okayclientcompany employee manage data this is a this is where i think you differentiate between your general user in your power user power user has the ability to manage the data thats really saying i can go after the tables i can get into the worksheets and i can manipulate those whereas the general user is just going to be viewing or using the worksheets that are developed by the power userclient rightremoved  removedcompany employee okay experimental features probably not for general users thats the beta features that come out every month that are not truly supposed to be generally available but they make them available if were looking for a control group to to analyze and give us feedback so this by a power user option if you if you want your power users to look at experimental features but again we need to let them know when those features and huh our analysis dont see many that are using our and actually our as maybe consider discontinued soon for another type of feature and its called bringing on charts is coming and our will be ultimately discontinued scheduling pin board pinboard clientcompany employee so you with that privilege and schedule a pin board and e mail it out to any number of people if you are in the share all users otherwise to your own user group and run it on a periodic basis thats what that is you see your general users scheduling pin boards and running them overnight and really that its not its not the old paradigm where were scheduling something to run and cash for the following morning this is running a pin board and sending it via emailclient yeah see i can see some users doing thatcompany employeecompany product is our company product feature probably wouldnt turn it off initially,0.9763,0.079,0.047,0.875

med,won,demo,company employee so moving on to how you how the data manager will work in this environment so theyre going to have access that data tab so lets go check lets go click on the data tab and let me turn off my slackcompany employee okay alright so on our data tab so the the data managers are going to be able to create connection so so lets go to your connections and i mentioned this briefly in the last call nice my head slack is still buzzy well whats toclientcompany employee come up with some naming conventions so that they create connection names that are understandable by people maybe having their division or whatever you call them internally as the first name and maybe a hyphen with whatever the use case name is so that you can start to segment out usage statistics and and even yeah look at the table sizes and understand okay open it up and it just it its a good management tool capability with proper naming convention to begin to manage the growth of your data and start looking at statistics through those connected needs data management  functions clientremoved  removed these connections each of these connection is thats unique to each data manager right its not its not something pretty defined for anyone any you know a data manager can go in and create it connectioncompany employee they can but i guess this is an area where you need to generate your own policies and procedures data architecture company employee you may want to live with a single connection and just have your data managers work in that environment or you know depending on how much you know are dividing and conquering data you can have multiple connections soyou can all workcompany employee through a single could actually be likeclientclienthi its like for third party vendor you probably have just one connection i dont know i mean imclient yeah yeah no youre youre youre youre right in the sense of the common db type stuff but like i say because name might have like an sdr data warehouse or something that he would want would want to have a third party vendor dash fdr versus third party vendor dash data management  functions client theres only thats but youre youre right on the overall in the context that you were talkingcompany employee yep yep but again the connection name who have the same user credentials and see the exact same tables but you assign them certain tables to one connected in certain tables to another connection or you can have two connections with two user ids that only see data available to that user idremoved  removed data management  functions ends company employee so its both the security mechanisms as well as an organizational approach to to evaluating how how data is being looked at the newscompany employee and again theres not really actually good documentation on this this is more of a best practice that i have used in my implementations so if you have further questions on that please please come to me okay so once i,0.9967,0.148,0.008,0.844
med,won,demo,company employee clicking back on your data tab once the data manager either uses an existing connection or creates their connection theyre going to be looking at tables so youre talking about tables tab you probably have a spot open up one of the tables youve youve seen what we provide as a data met a data right off the table so this is our own company met a data about that table the only thing we cant change it here is the data type the data comes from your database but we can change everything else do need a discussion of what all of these different met a data attributes mean data management  functions ends client i think we went over this starting the psc so i think i think im good we hard code because i know you guys are also on the call do you need any certifications maybe a quick summary yeah i think she i of course somebody would do because we would want to explore this at that end as well so you know weve just got back today so we get into this and have a local and come back with any questions but for now if he can have a quickcompany employee yeah i was gonna do a quick summary thats great so again best practice here your column names up here still have the physical column name on the table what we what we like to do is copy and paste those column names to the description column to keep that relationship to the physical problem name and well do that through a spreadsheet download what were talking about that the second and then you apply your business name for that column name and again as a bulk update you can use a spreadsheet to do that if the table to small you can stayremoved  removedwithin the ui and do it that way but the column name is your business name and the description hold on to your physical column name just to be able to provide that link text if you will to where that data is coming from the description will pop when you hover over the column name in your ui so all users will see that description field when they hover over that column in the column name will also be the header to your reports as well as the legend your charts and then you have synonyms switches over there wouldnt do three four five six seven yes where you can create and search experience that allows someone to talk in their terms to reference bpm as customer or vpn as clients or account the search bar will convert that sending them into bpm so vpn is where youll see and all your charts and graphs that you might be sharing with people so be reminded of that so i would think vpn might want to be a certain number of people talking about us terms and then column name is whoever wins customer client account okay so thats your column names descriptions and synonyms again your column or your data type doesnt change by default the company will assign of our card to an attribute or an integer to measure so thanks in new jersey being summed our cars cannot if you have an integer that is an attribute looks like youve already change your in month you want to change it to attribute and turn off its aggregation rules and then its treated as an attribute no longer will be some done the search bar as important so when you bring in and disable those are the first things you wanna docompany employee and do we have any measures so you could actually sort on column type and bubble up measures earlier seniority or something by default some is the aggregation rule there are also averages if you if we measure it doesnt make sense to be some across dimensional attributes that you can change it to an average and continue to a max to change it to a man if you drop down that availability there itll tell you all the different aggregation rules you can apply you click on some little dropdown menu maybe scroll there you go so theres all the aggregation rules im counting kept the states i really dont like to use here i would use that in the formula hidden is what it means either youre not going to show the the person the the end users the ability to access this column or you will this might be a thing you want to apply to it id column a surrogate value thats only news and linkage versus recording now remember and system tables youre really defining the default behavior the default met a data that is inherited by worksheets data management  functions company employee so youre never going to give access to the table to anybody youre going to give them access to worksheets and so when youre building worksheets the idea here on this met a data at the table level is that this is that met a data you want that worksheet to inherit and whats the worksheet is created it assumes all of that met a data meaning it owns that met a data at that point that worksheet becomes an object in its own right now no longer will inherit any other changes you make this table so you really want to make changes to the table once and allow worksheets to build off of thatremoved  removed alsoclientcompany employee data management  functions ends company employee because assuming to start changing your well again after worksheets have been created and youve got some discrepancy going on between the two im scrolling over index type ive seen a good best practice where people will set that to dont index for everything well do that in the bulk tool data architecture company employee and the second and then you and what this is telling us start telling company is index the values set at the search bar so the reason why people turn it off especially a cloud warehouses is because whatever value is set to index its gonna launch a query every  hours against your third party vendor warehouse and and pull back all possible values and put them in an index search if your search bar as well data architecture ends company employee so its its not that expensive but it doesnt launch these every  hours to refresh the index see you and managing how search ahead works if youre if you accept default behavior which default behavior on an attribute is were going to index it its kind of misleading you dont know what default names but default that an attribute is index it default on a measure is dont index it i wouldnt worry about the prefix only and all that thats thats thats trying to save space and youre on the cloud dont worry about it but if you allow it to do default behavior and then you go to your search bar youre gonna have a lot of values pop up on your type of bad suggestions that you may not even understand what they are but it so i feel limited and then are opening it up slowly gives you a better concept of how that search ahead features working makes need user experience that much better and and much more controllable by you geo config is the ability to assign a lot logs and states if you if you have this data or that long you can assign that geo config attribute and that will force company to map the we split the chart as opposed to use a bar chart or a line chart search types company employeeremoved  removed it opened up index priority only for only for the risk risk takers that is tell you company too deep prioritize or prioritize this column in the type forward suggestions i would leave it as default into one and allow the ai engine and company to learn from the user and the group so the way type ahead works is it looks at your individual behavior it looks at your groups behavior and then it looks at the enterprise behavior and through all of that over time it generates suggestions depending on whats used most so let the ai ends and make those suggestions theyll try to fool with the priority settings to to make it not to suggest something just turn it off if you dont want it to suggest anyway format pattern search types ends clientcompany employee is for numbers percentages removed commas decimal places this is not well documented but its just the pound sign pound sign comma if you know limiting the number of decision and the number of for example currency type if youre in removed y d you know put a dollar sign in front of your number attributes and dimension data management  functions company employee and again for their risk taker is up there that is telling company to change the way it joins results sets when so what company does is it will parse out your request into multiple sequels and then joined those equals and then the final result set and this attributes as i mentioned feature will either say use this column as a join condition and that final results that are dont use this callclient well it doesnt have anything to do with like a star schemer dimension like an attribute of thecompany employee kind of it yeah theres a theres a correlation if you have dimensions and facts and im looking at two different demands theres a single measure its going to go out and look at those individually and its gonna bring it back and if i want to say i dont want sales group note to be part of that join between the two results then i would turn it noclient gotcha gotcha almost like filtering on a category within thatremoved  removedcompany employee yeah you you really need to experiment with this and see what its doing and i i am on a closet very seldomlyclient  be fun we know or i guess because okaycompany employee yes because you want company to use all the join conditions that you create and formulate the final join company product company employee using this is really telling you to override the joined condition company product by default everything is a spike doable meaning that you will be if somebody if he was

med,won,company product,lientthe key here also now and if youre gonna roll out if your if your data manager and youre going to roll out a worksheet to end users you want to make sure that your tables are viewable by that end user group so i did we make changes you want to save them or you wanna probably discard the changes yeah this guy just click into data tab itll ask you to describeyeah so when youre done setting up your tables if you go hover on the left of the table name youll get a checkbox go ahead and check the box and youll share it does click on share youll want to share that to your user group as a viewable object so that when you build the worksheet and you share the worksheet they can use it or actually no thats why when you want to give some sorry so a little bit of a i would probably a best practice give him you probably well im gonna take that backremoved  removedclientwhat if i only want to give you privileges for you was on the worksheetcompany employeethen they dont have to have you really do is on the tableclient pinboard company employee now if you give them a view of privileges theyre gonna see it as a an option to choose to to to search it and the rate and so im gonna back up my statement you want to give you privileges to those people that youre going to give edit privileges on their worksheets its not only pinboard ends clientcompany employee going to get a view of privileges to end users on your worksheets then you dont have and it probably is the best practice because you dont want to let them look at raw tablesso i mean it doesnt obstruct anything where linkedin still see the worksheet and the columns and ive done everything they can access everythingcompany employee youd probably want to start from that place and not give them view if you have a set of users that you want to give edit privileges to on the worksheet that we have to give them you privileges tables behind got itclientcompany employeecompany employeeremoved  removed okay which moves us to the worksheets you click on the worksheet tab open this worksheet lets go ahead and edit the worksheet data management  functions company employee and you know how to add additional sources you got the plus sign over there next to the sources yep and if you wanted to add additional tables to the smart sheet this is where you would do it the the table that joined this guy go back to so lets close out of this back to your data and lets open up a table open one up and lets look at your joins condition so youll define your default joined condition here right now we have a many to one between about renewals entry is renewals and its an inner join that so when you build a worksheet its gonna hurt just joined condition so back to worksheetscompany employee and if you edit the edit works yeah you can click on click on the join condition so youve inherited that joined condition but it looks like you change that to an outer join so thats what i was going to shift so youve already done what i was going to but outer joins are very expensive and and really an outer join in in in my theory is is is the option to defend against dirty data i would prefer if youre missing a row and one table versus the other i would prefer to throw a w role in there and do an inner join youre going to get much betterclient and maybe that can be done before we get into company and not use company do the end to be the engine that rightcompany employee right yeah so back and stuff like look for youre missing rose create a dummy row and then do inner joins and company thats thatsclient but doesnt mean all fairness to you right you may have been like okay im working on something let me just pull this quickly but not knowing that theyre very expensive in the time right yeah so rightclientcompany employee just fineremoved  removedclient no i mean i was just thinking is it is it better to do these joints and third party vendor banned in company or it doesnt mattercompany employeecompany employee question hi have seen people try to create views and the third party vendor that will force joined condition no dont do that allows company to build your join condition scoring so it is much more intelligent and much more efficient at creating your wear clauses and youre joined conditions and only joining those tables are needed for the search in question ive seen some people that like to build views that they want to date i dont know if you feel more comfortable doing that to to force join condition the work the way they want them to work but then you know when you go and search on total whatever total of something youre going to go join all those tables together to do that where its last last name or something like one tables that are factors we looked at the met a data and just pull back a number thats already been generated by the met a dataclient i got a question though on that is that assuming that the relationships were already setup though no need to have reallycompany employee stuff setup i dont and stuff like a better effect there is no such concept the primary key foreign key yeahclientcompany employee so so now it doesnt need relationships you you build them here at the met a data levelclient how does it i mean how does it know like i mean your scan you scan all the data and then you determine that okay this is the this is the primary key or this and then this is the foreign keycompany employeeremoved  removed its the magic of calling yeah okay yeah it doesnt have that concept its its setting column or storage side by side and and looking for like valuesclient  gotcha yep which would make sensecompany employee alright so weve inherited the giant condition weve over written that joined condition with an outer join thats what you can do here at the worksheet level it will always be an inner join table level im moving back to edit the worksheet lets go ahead and edit the worksheet so when you bring a new sources youre going to what will happen is if theres not a joined condition and between does that source in any of these tables its got a gray it out so im gonna let you bring it in so if you see that youll know that theres not a join condition that doesnt know how to that table to the rest of the tables in the worksheet so youll have to go back to the tables and create that join,0.9988,0.136,0.024,0.84
med,won,company product,company employee the other thing thats nice about creating as i was talking about earlier the business names in the tables is that when you bring them into this worksheet its going to bring those business names as you can say right now you got all physical names and its not a good practice to change all these physical names to business names here because you know lose that linkage back to that that physical made you want to keep that linkage in the table and change the business names there and then have those business names being inherited by this worksheet helloclientcompany employee so again were trying to stay focused on security so i wont go into formulas if you go into filters that is another way of doing rls role level security you can have what renewals for the south and web renewals for the east or and you could then filter on region in that in that will that filter will be carried around and attached to every sequel that is issue by company very similar approach to row level security okayclientcompany employeeremoved  removed its dangerous though you know sometimes people are wondering why that filter is there and they have to find out why and where so when you do put these on their be aware that its gonna create a word clause that some people dont understand you know if it goes through cancel out of that and then go back to the data tab pinboard company employee and ultimately when youre ready to publish course you hover over web renewals on the check box to the left click on it sure yeah you could share from here or share it from there yep the share button and you shared and this is already share both as a view and edit pinboard ends company employee and actually thats a good good example so back to what i was saying so if you if you share it as a view to that group client bows then client doesnt mean you probably just the tables but if you share it as an that tree needs you privileges to the tables behind this got it okay pinboard clientclientcompany employee were running running up against time i was gonna go over were talking about sharing you can share obviously your share your worksheets once you share your worksheets those users when they come into their company home screen will have the ability to select those worksheets do a search and lets go over to the home button pinboard ends company employee lets check on it were not gonna talk about this tab yet but if you click on search it should if you click on the search bar it should pop you into a search goremoved  removedahead and click on it whats your balance in there and like is it is it not changing i forgot to change it over there then wow search types company employeecompany employee  yeah its its exchange automaticallycompany employee helloclient  somebody asked me a question bye byecompany employee so as it learns behavior so youve got it over there on the database simple right now right and if you click into the search bar its itll automatically put you into a searchclient okaycompany employee at the and it starts to learn your behavior patterns pinboard company employee and so right now youre searching data rather than searching assets of what this is if you go back to the home button and and you click in that search right with search answer there you go so you can toggle that to search answers and then you performance right now youre searching data pinboard ends company employeeremoved  removed if you click that yeah and then you go back to the search bar here now searching answers youre searching your library of answers kovid so little confused yeahclientclientclient yeah this this feature was very confusing for our end users they could not locate way to search and you know have to show them okay toggle between two yeah yeah we got aclientcompany employee lot of the feedback loop first roll that out and thats why i was confused i think yeah yup yup its holding onto your default position of database so every time you click on search its to change now right rightclientcompany employeecompany employee  thats that was a key updates that we didclient i remember when we first started the plc we had a search option right here in the in the in the black bar rightcompany employeeclientremoved  removed it was so easy to just go back and say you know click on search and then you would have youd get this this windowcompany employee address voices to the money yeah i would like to have that search back as wellclient its just easy navigation happy for him right and you said go in they can just stuck with the suchcompany employee  yeah have you been talking tocompany employeecompany employeerequest the feature enhancements will put that on the listclientyeah i i dont know how we can do that yeahcompany employeewhen i say add your voice to the money thats kind of how we get featuresyeah that should not be one its hard to do either so all right were on the search barclient i went back to them and says do you want me to go back to datacompany employee so really what i wanted to end with was really the ability for all and so your you as a data manager shares or worksheets out to the end user the end user thenyeahclientcompany employeeremoved  removedand select the worksheet they want to work with they can actually select multiple worksheets and as soon as you begin your search it will and you select what search attribute you want to bring into the search bar it automatically will then only give you suggestions for that worksheet pinboard company employee so and then if you read all the attributes all the worksheets open up again you have the ability to maybe change the worksheet if you like and then once you create your answers and or pin them to pin boards the same features available to end users its available to data managers they can select their answer yep so here we have no answers lets go to the pin boards or yeah go off got all the answers maybe you dont want to share out these system answers alright company employee lives as a lot so yeah you can hover over them just like we do on worksheets and like them and share them out yeah sure let me look here and you can share these out to either groups or users and enable them see them in their selection listclient okaycompany employee and the same applies the pin boards so that is what i wanted to teach todayclient hey company employee a quick question on data refreshes today i think it it it its all dependent upon the data architecture company employeeclientclient underlying table in third party vendor name because this is searching the data searching on  your time data so if the data isnt third party vendor is updated i was off yesterday thats what were gonna see in in in company theres not gonna be any other schedule to be for issues that we have todaycompany employeeremoved  removed company im like a lot of other bi tools is live query so its going to pull data from third party vendor and its not going to but it will it will cache results so but if something were to nameis going to refresh that cash but we dont build any automatic cashes in the morning and have people do searches on those catches the first person that runs a pin board for example is gonna catch that data when they run it and so its all live query data transfer client sometimes what happens is i mean we have a few tables that any finish doing the end of our day and it takes closer no onecompany employeeclient point five us but then to refresh so during that time with the data in the dashboard of the beyondcompany employee  and schedule the dashboard pinboard company employee so yeah if you schedule the dashboard for six i am you can sort of mimic what a traditional cash we especially would look like so if that dashboard runs that pin board runs every morning at six a m and email it to yourself then youve captured all the results so the next person opens a pin board is going to be that much and so my pin board today okayclientclientclient my pin boards we continue to you know continue to include the data like for example i have i guess let me here but if i have a pin board and its showing me or trend both you know monthly see its right so in  one right now only haveremoved  removeddata for  but essentially if might be able has data thats updating ftp i will see that number is getting added or do i need to make it a fresh the pin board or something like that okaycompany employee no you would have to refresh pinboard ends company employee if you had a web page open its not

med,won,about company,account executive so shall i start with a quick who is company where do we fit in the marketplace yup yup okay awesome so high level company is applying search to the analytics space where the modern analytics stack and what that means is historically its taken anywhere from one resource individually search types account executive so a person in an hour a week every time somebody has a question to get an answer from that question company is really trying to apply the ways search weremoved   removedhave interact as consumers so we go to third party vendor we ask a question and we get an answer if were looking for a new product we go to third party vendor we type in the keywords of what were looking for and we get an answer in real time companys applying that same exact concept to the analytic stack making it extremely easy for anybody regardless of their technical experience to be able to gain insights from their data company product account executive on the second pillar thats layering on top of this is what we call our company product engine think of this as an interrogation engine that looks for anomalies in your data and especially when we start looking at the size and scope of data that clientdoes every single day it will help you find the anomalies that could be statistically relevant for your business company product ends account executive so thats really the core of what were doing as far as our customer a lot of them look just like client s so calm guys horizon very similar the reason that they they brought company in was because theres a lot of people with a lot of questions and a lot of data to sift through data architecture account executive company really solving that problem for them to make it really truly enabling and realizing that selfservice division that they had a big technology and innovation partnership just to speak about because i know we are going to be launching directly on third party vendor database so last year we were third party vendors technology partner of the year they invested removed into company this year we partner super closely on the go to market front and you guys will hopefully see through this process how seamlessly the partnership with between us will enable client  unlock the data that you have invested into third party vendor so pausing there does anyone have any questions for me data management  functions company employee so just do one planningclient no click or anything like the same we we do work things out eveningremoved   removedcompany employee and ski my name on the data getting captured on the web version architects coveragesales engineer yeah i do i told the top ill actually walk you through that process but connecting to tables and youre using the table names to then drive everything outside and we generate the query against third party vendor dynamicallysure okay awesomeany other questions team industry issues clientaccount executiveaccount executiveokay awesome i guess just two more slides to talk through to really frame the problem were solving and i i would really love to understand how new segment as engaged today what the client  so were company employee or wrote it i dont know if you can provide some color on this but ultimately what our other customers tell us this looks like is its a very complicated and cumbersome process to go from source of data which in this case would be third party vendor and ultimately make the idea you know functional sizeable cubes and aggregated and then put it into a report that a bi team ultimately services back to in this case the c suite for sales or finance or anyone in your organization what the what company is doing too flip this model on the head is connect straight to the source so again in this case third party vendor and really enable the business with the ability to ask questions from from the source without having to go through to to three two four more layers of servicing the data before it gets served into a static report that eventually is looking back hide site and very often by the time it gets into the users hands in the business its a few weeks outdated anyways so we really want to enable this real time type of interaction with your data so that the businesses better enable to make decisions on it using deep so im pausing there could were shot and maybe its taught me a little bit more is new segment today like helping build any of these reports or is this being are they is the team being brought in for the sake of the plc soclient it actually they have experience and building the reports and dashboards and w now that youve signed up for the company youll see theyll be responsible completely to build the dashboards and you know explore the explore all the features and parts part and then the report to usremoved   removed,0.9972,0.108,0.013,0.879
med,won,about company,client maybe in the fall im also one and the one in the removed for document read theyll be writing that analysis on company and add that you know about actually building the lake you know actually excluding those features okay so yeah wed be providing them our data lake what we discussed over the over the chart that is the monthly analysis ip search data will be giving it to them and theyll be getting forward with all the analysis from that onaccount executive awesome joining do you have any questionssales engineer when do you get started and you know well take the questions along along the way as we go through it agenda account executive perfect thank you that sounds great so do you want to jump insales engineer yeah let me go ahead and as i jump into this asaccount executive mentioned what im gonna focus on this two aspects of it id run is very quickly the end user experience and im not gonna go through a very deep and user experience demo,0.9779,0.146,0.0,0.854
med,won,demo,sales engineer we can always cover those things as we go through the bmc as well i just wanted to give you the two flavors of of of things that are asking the questions that you know to ask and then augmenting guy and said shiny using and setting you know augmented insights search types ends sales engineer those would be the two aspects that focus on the end user experience and then focus switch switch over to the notion of alright so you have data and third party vendor how do i get to the demo that i just showed does that make sense yup yeah look let me show you this is your time i wanted to do you know i mean please absolutely ask questions and if itll be done over well well find a way toremoved   removedmake sure we got all your questions address right but this i just wanted to see a pickle so so lets just talk about the end user experience industry issues sales engineer its when people come in and theyre looking for content and so on you know theres lots of new obviously have lots of reports and dashboards that youve built out right thats sort of one aspect of the challenge and you have content how can i quickly find out you know and someone says hey what am i top products or something like that industry issues ends sales engineer right if i type sorry i was searching here right if i say what am i top products and things like that if i type something like that in its gonna go through search there search everything that anyone in the team has created and if youre allowed to see that right you may actually see a preview option as well but its not just doing two names of searches into entertaining in some cases products and you know for example product matches my search them but also its going through the search itself to say how was this content generated right data drill down sales engineer what am i top selling products or you know these are the tears hey here the sales dropped so this is giving you a view of people have been looking you know its the actual so its meant to make up any one of these these solutions right i switch gears to rather than do it that way data drill down ends sales engineer just if i have more questions you know and i have my one question that this is sort of where how hi bruce its sorta frame the question is youre not going to be repeat every single visual representation that was in in the outcome of of the data that that youve been looking at right search types sales engineer rather than that when people have questions how can i quickly answer questions right and so thats why a search content thats on the actual data weremoved   removedhave thing and users non technical users can ask questions so if i if i just wanna look at this this is a retail dataset data drill down sales engineer so i say i wanna look at sales by region and its gonna say hey by the way sales is i know sales is is a measure somewhere someones defined it to him i can pick that out how about region right by the way theres so many different basis and region can be found in the retail sales area as stories and customer region or something out data drill down ends sales engineer so use users get onto that and then maybe quarterly brain right youll just see as im typing these that youre seeing type ahead suggestions so all of this is basically commercial search concepts applied on top of tables and columns of data and then i hit enter its gonna go ahead and run that query and it gives you a result data drill down sales engineer notice a couple of things happened when i did that it took my terms it got ran something against third party vendor it gave me the results and it says hey by the way looking at the results it looks like youre looking for a data with just some sort of cringe at the best represented as a line chart if i wanted to change sec i cook right and theres a whole host of visual representations youre going to go through that during the plc but lets just dive into a little bit around what happened here right when i said sales by region on a quarterly green even though my data itself is down at individual store level and those are the product skew level on every day at different times of the day data management  functions sales engineer it says hey this information can be brought up gathered from the folding tables its got an order details table in order header table and the store to mention to you but thats what i could source it prompts and company dynamically took my search terms i can find this information in these tables and and it says heres the sequel statement that im going to generate again third party vendor execute that again third party vendor get the results and presented back question that this one hi name just one quickclientremoved   removed so can read theyeah got it bigsales engineer so thats the focus thats the audience search types ends sales engineerclientaccount executiveclient  sequel queries and everything yeah onesales engineer you dont edit the sequel statement itself search types sales engineer we dont its you will change the search terms to make the sequel do what youneeded to do okay and heres the reason why like if you think about this non technical users do not know how to write sequel statementsclientyoure going off direct making sure those people right as as the cto zooming the halls and with the ipad right talking to the key influence influencers across the organization and client  and they dont need they shouldnt have to write sequel statements i suppose now as i did this by the way quarterly for example is you know as i said the data is actually at the granular time time let robin big time level quarterlies a keyword right its good to understand that hey if i could take the base thereclientsales engineerremoved   removed data and you know i should have give me just a second i should have said that my bad extra sentence slacksales engineer  but it is for that and just a sec data drill down sales engineer okay sorry about that so so now that thats their right thats one piece but the other aspect is on time is just dying to mentioned that i could have said quarterly monthly daily hourly right then youve got a lot of data in here which is all on an auto basis that you will be looking through as well data drill down ends sales engineer so richard are showing that yesterday or maybe i want to just look at the last lets say eight quarters right so as i start typing in i just stop hearing loss need any aspect of time you could roll out right whether its days hours weeks you know all of that data drill down sales engineer just company understand this i can take the data and i can pull it up so people can get to whatever they want and im gonna say i wanna look at just the last quarters and itll filter the results down right thats the basic premise behind this now you can take that a step further i can looking at this and saying hey by the way i see in the last eight quarters you know southwest has been going up whereas whatever else is being down you know what happened down here right i want to go drill down into what whats going on in mid mid west or something like that data drill down ends sales engineer no i think about what happens here from an from a business users questions perspective is they can you know depending on what they see it could be asking any you know what maybe driving some of these behaviors that they need the ability to go anywhere in the data and thats why setting company on top of granular data so powerful because now you can let the users go anywhere you dont have to build a a you know a hierarchy or growbots is know quoted links right you go anywhere in the data set that you want toremoved   removed data drill down sales engineer and so i could have you know funded or lets just say i to put a particular place i want to look at is still states simply done right there right im looking in the midwest yeah it looks like you know state had some good sales let me see what they were doing down there maybe i look at it by the product right and i look at the product information and theres you know theres gonna be a lot of products maybe i just wanted to get the top lets say  products just simply by typing that in i now know in that particular quarter in state right data management  functions sales engineer what are the top putting products and by the way if you are following the the the the secret buck i brought in product information company automatically figure that out right that hey i could grab that bring that in from relating it to the order details table and being back together agenda sales engineer so thats at a very quick glance how add hawk search works when you know the questions you wanted right let me pause there any questions you might haveclient  any questions nope alrightsales engineer well look im sure its gonna prompt question so dont be shy im here to help you out agenda ends sales engineer as soon as you go through it just view me as an extension of your team as youre going through this so if questions come up at a later point i think you all have i mean in the email thing as well and youre gonna see a lot more of me through the evaluation anyway so right displayed on anything that my suggestion if something comes up just let the question down you can either shoot it to me in an email or you know when youre going through this field meeting just set up a time to go with them of course by the way you know hey what youre looking at data you can always change or third party vendor view you can you can add formulas if you want to do things like that look download the data i think any of that type ofremoved   removedinformation it could be doing and if youre wondering where the search terms come from my user has access to many different areas of analysis in this case i was looking at the sales data and here are all the different fields right now i have you havent got into the security aspects of it but you know i dont know what thatll be for the plc perspective from him but she was issued to you what type of data but if you have that kind of a scenario as well keep in mind that any of these fields that you see here all for that matter the type ahead suggestions right pinboard sales engineer what youre seeing is always going to be different but your security profile so if youre not allowed to see something you wont see it okay now im gonna switch gears a little bit im going to say hey look all this while weve been looking at you know weve been looking at questions that due to aspect what and you know let me just back up and one other point in here at any point if you think this is something that you wanted to save the onset do right you can just spin it to be you can just go here and im gonna call this is joy the dashboard and i can just keep building will be answers and thats the process that you say hey this is a view i want to save and do something and i can come back to the pin board and do additional things around there data drill down sales engineer now as i was saying i was gonna change this around and say hey look i know sales on a quarterly basis right and and that that was changing and lets see let me do this okay let me just stop you right i see that it went up from here to here data drill down ends sales engineer now in the ideal world you know what might be driving your business but you know especially with this data set but i think theres  columns of data that could be any of those could drive your business one way or the other right maybe it is it is the the the gigabyte utilization right some been that youre looking at or is looking at what what is your the speed that youve subscribed for and all of those right so many different flavors of things device devices all of that kind of information so when you want to find out what changed check what explains is different company product sales engineer this is where youll find in a friend so i could find those manually or i could say maybe phone a friend and that friend to company product or augmented insights engineremoved   removedyeah so when i click those two points and say hey i wanna do a quick competitive analysis,0.9994,0.085,0.01,0.905
med,won,demo,sales engineer doesnt mean what drove that change so what company phases ive seen her jody has been using it ive seen how whats been using it and you know how she has been using it and others right and so based upon that here or columns that may make sense for you to use right so its group sort of crowdsourcing information about your users with that data of course its also applying behind the scenes to say some columns just dont make sense because theyre not you know they they dont belong together and then of course i can go through and you know override anything and just say hey i actually do care about i can price or you know certain other things and then just go ahead and say maybe the store zip code is important as well company product sales engineer still county and click analyze so you get suggestions you can put your own insights around like hey i actually want to include other columns or if you have selected all columns every single one of these right and when you do that thought spot goes and runs lots of searches against your third party vendor environment and puts all the results into company product right so when i do this heres what you know nine seconds ago and did a comparative analysis heres what happened right so it says hey sales increase seven percent and it gives you a natural language you dont have it but heres some of the key drivers of the sands right in this case so the key driver analysis is what youre doing yeah so dense go say  stores you know and it gives you a natural language we got about that is it  stores contributor the largest change on the positive side arlington heights has been doing well on the negative side you know cincinnati had a big truck right now could you have found this out absolutely could does this help you get  it could be to see maybe youre not quite a bit and maybe this is a great place to start thats exactly what hello hello you to do it finds the outliers the correlations and trends in their data and surface them to you in a recommended right when i do this so you can easily get to the answers and it gives you a natural language reach out but then it does something more than that negative let me get your feedback because you guys are subject matter experts right and you can tell me if this is useful if you find this useful give me an a plus or minus a thumbs up or thumbs down right i could be looking to pay lots of different zip codes have not been doing that maybe i dont care about the zip code level details and says hey whys that thing is that the fact that zip code is not useful or you know this particular zip code is not interesting for your comparison or sometimes you know what you might have is you know that in your data youre always gonna have two or three points which are outliers you expect that to be a mix you know its an expected outlet right and so you say hey thats expected i know that designed to be that way you can give that feedback click on that give thatremoved   removedfeedback to now company understands that next time i see something like this dont include that in my feedback company product ends sales engineer so what field building in through this process is a feedback mechanism for you your users to guide the analytics and give you a better insight stream and that in that gets better and better and better as more and more people use it so this way you start getting lot more relevant suggestions of course any of these visual representation company product sales engineer but if if youre wondering what what happened behind the scenes you can always edit that and youll see it the same from the sales right for queue three and then compare the seo to key to calculate the changes you know found the tissues and highlighted them based upon their specialty company product ends sales engineer and you could take this and start doing additional things i could always have gone to build from all the other things that that was actually before so let me stop and take any questions on thisclient yeah majority of i have a question yes so when you talked about the formulas right so when we create your phone will all be saved with the suppose a unique name and say you come tomorrow again and you want to see use the same formula can we do that for any other visualizationsales engineer yes so so formulas can be done on an ad hawk basis when youre searching it can also be done at the worksheet level right so i didnt introduce it dont want you to let me just talk about that for a second so when i was actually let me just go go back this search right so when i was searching these things that looks right to what youre seeing here data management  functions sales engineerremoved   removed so it looks at the worksheets that basically things that maybe across one or more tables may have some filtering above those tables may have additional formula so if you know that data  or  key you know kpis and metrics that you want to run your business by so that everyone doesnt have to be at or do you just defined that in the book sheet data management  functions ends sales engineer and i was gonna talk about how we build that in a moment but do you do that i get added to the worksheet and that way its always there all right thanksclientsales engineer so you know its what  but  minutes in definitely this was the end use extent this this a lot more pinboard sales engineer i havent gone into the pin board aspect of it so if im good so as i was looking through here that i can i go hey by the way so theres you know someone build a dashboard thats my favorite dashboard you know the other things around that is hey when im looking at these a lot of times people will put in interactivity within dashboard say i know when you click on something i want to bring up something else as well right on approach to thats been slightly different and say hey why did you can you you know when youre doing this when someone zix explore or looking at this visual representation of what i understand what happened i can always click explorer and it gives you on in place exploration but in dashboard exploration option and now i can go to hi this and say hey this is my chart right but on the right hand side youll see suggestions of what others have done so the next best actions that people date when they look at these visual representations right search types sales engineer youre driving the use the same way as we applying you saw how be applied to the insights aspect of it is this relevant or not because we understand the user behavior on top of of your data we also know how people are interacting with this data when they look at something what else did they look at at data drill down removed   removedsales engineer what are the next thing they looked at and so thats where these suggestions are coming from i can filter the results one day just one click actions that hey in the last six months what happened or add additional attributes or replace something thats a mature so slightly different use case pinboard sales engineer this is to say when youve already designed this so its its been giving people that contain be to explore that to a dashboard can absolutely do you have a lot more things or anything that you can subscribe these two people so they can get it you can download it you know and the whole mess as a whole dashboard on and those are the visual representations you can do many of those things right industry issues sales engineer but different perspective people who are comfortable with dashboards and live and die by dashboard go down this experience and the moment someone has more questions you know the whole idea is you dont necessarily need a dashboard just because you have a question right because you think about the average adoption of dashboards in the industry today,0.9988,0.097,0.017,0.886
med,won,about company,sales engineer you know weve weve got an extremely large customers for example lackland others  dashboards in the environment and third party vendor and you name how much is getting use beyond to varies between two percent maybe  or  percent on the high end its pretty sad state of adoption by all of your all the people are building things out for customers industry issues sales engineer and yet when it comes down to using it only some of it gets used why because a lot of times you build something and this comes back to one of the site thataccount executive had right what take over the whole process you go through you build out these dashboards and by the time you get the dashboards out to people either the questions changed or the problem is going away and people never look at right or they say give me a few other things and so now you build that whole cycle up so if youre trying to give you the basic dashboarding capabilities but also allowing the end users to go off road and ask their own questionsremoved   removed industry issues ends sales engineer so thats the user experience let me stop there any questions you might have on the user experience and then we will change sort of pivot into how do we get to this choiceclient is there a limit to the number of fields that we can add to a particular visualization data drill down client because there was a there was one thing which we experienced so when we were using multiple fields in the y axis we were not able to to add columns in the slice with color bucketsales engineer some visual representation is gonna limit that and that depends on on the visual visualization itself right industry issues sales engineer and thats more because okay we tend to see you know again the the approach that weve taken as you have a question just provide the answer quickly right so you can get to it so a lot of times a lot of these visual representation come that be mainly because youre trying to back into a lot more information than than you normally about company sales engineer but the other piece id say yeah we had a recent one of the huge banks out of city they completely standardized on company as their their bi tool of choice and look they have every bi tools like third party vendor included third party vendor like you know strategy many others right about company ends sales engineerremoved   removed and its just put company on top of that and one of the things we put them because we obviously but were not trying to put every single visual representation in a visualization library yes we know we need to do a little bit better and some of those spaces but this adobe defensive because if you look about this most of the time people look at by chart column chart line charts and a few others right and  to  percent of the visual representation that people use today already called now so and i and ive been on the other side ive been ive i mean ive ive been in the bi space at this point for what   some years about company sales engineer and early on in my life i was a product manager right and i was looking at the next call this visualization representation and i you know it was like hey why because thats that seems cool,0.9876,0.072,0.011,0.917
med,won,company product,ales engineer and then you ask people how many people actually understand how to be the chart and you go simplicity all investments right and so thats thats the other angle around it because ive had question but you know im sure as youre doing this during the evaluation that lets go with those when you have time to do this then maybe a couple of ways of doing this so then those exactly what our offices and so on are going to be along the whole evaluation cycle right so when you have a question hey im stuck im trying to do this how do i do this i will jump on ill give you a couple of suggestions how to do it and the idea so youd feature so its hard to do it and become self sufficient pinboard client yep so can you like toggle to the pin board real quick because they were they were a few dogs that we had and up in city so like for example if i want to change the size of a particular visualization do i have the only six options provided in the bottom pinboard ends sales engineer yeah those are the those options that you see there were five options that you see those are the only four or five we provide right now visualization and in general pin boards are going to see a bigger all left in our upcoming releases but you know right now these are the only options if youve gotremoved   removed pinboard client okay and like they will they were a few visualizations for which the access labels were missing if we upload a smaller j a smaller sizesales engineer yeah and and this is more around you know at any point right think about this when someones looking at any any visual representation i can go into presentation mode so now if i go down hey im looking through each one of these the ideas if im looking at visual representation just like that i can always go look at it in full screen mode youll see everything and data so what weve tried to go to that user experiences and you want to back a lot of information out of you know taking taking a minimalistic you around so the charts dont get overly complicated but find someone wants to look at the quote screen just look at everything that i wonder do you can just go into full screen mode you know go into any one of the visual representation edit that of course we have the right to do it on the back end yeah you see that right here you dont know which one investors you mouse over so weve tried to use multiple steps but hey if you wanted to change this out now you may not have your end users may not be given the edit right so in that case they wont get to do that but theyll always be able too i hate what am i looking at let me go to present my sequel yep pinboard ends clientmaanshi ill tell you the same chart can we like moved or do you generally have a strong the dog my dog or something like that can we leave it to be valuablesales engineer again weve chosen the middle minimalistic design approach right so so thats why we we try to keep that you know the do not give that condition here industry issues sales engineer that again other flexibility keep in mind again what are we trying to get towards how can end users get the answers and move onto something else that we really need to be doing right and so dashboards and all of those have spent an enormous amount of time right trying to i want to position this exactly right hello so were not going for pixel perfect perfect basement of certain things wereremoved   removedtrying to say can we get that out is that and then let people get to the next question actually the day job right most of the people are looking at this information is a piece of the their daily job industry issues ends sales engineer and so you know we have attended get to that point and and get you the information so you can move on now if you really wanted to change some things you know in in in over a period of time what we are trying to do is go to this idea of bringing on charts or if you wanted to take this embed this in an environment and put your own graph until you can do thatmaanshi okay alright and also from thats been bored gonna user generate insights from using company productsales engineer well at any point but then these right you canmaanshi yeah yeah a tool the chats its okay for the whole has been voted deposit there to generate insightssales engineer so the the used to have that as a capability where you know its and all the visual representations we would have the ability we would expose visual that you know insights around there industry issues sales engineer and what we had people tell us is that you know that why thats useful the almost didnt want to coming because a lot of times when youre going through the dashboards youre saying this is my core message i want to i want you to take away but you know as soon as i get into any one of these right you can always have the visual you can go to spot i couldnt have the insights come up from thereaccount executive right and team just one thing to reiterate because company is not necessarily another dashboarding tool the visualizations or something that we offer but its a way to consume and export data i think thats a really important shift we make it really like company giving non technical users and executives in thisremoved   removedcase the ability to more freely explore data at huge volumes it very granular levels and if dashboarding is the tool like really beautiful visualizations third party vendor is great at that company is really trying to solve a very different problem so i just wanted to make that distinctionsales engineer comes back down to something as a russian i think bruce it made that comment as well that is the goal is not to replicate dashboard because you have enough of those the goal was to make sure that when people have those questions can be quickly get to those questions and and so on so it doesnt necessarily come back to the team again to say heres another heres another dashboard for you have three other questions and tomorrow to come back in and out of those three i want for other things because look and when you think about that  columns of data how many of them categorical its two could slice it a remove days right how many possibilities of questions are there and the dashboard never suffice put that together you can never really let you know if you look to the probability of those and i havent gone to your data subject and figure that out as to what the combinations would be theres just too many combinations to put into a dashboard and i and i used to champion dashboards a long time in my life and was like hey let me figure it out and go through an extensive set of questions to see what are those questions and then ive got you know one level two level then at some point the dashboard it becomes too and really to manager to take forever to open up you know and then your users would get it then nicole what am i looking at and thats what were trying to avoid that yeah you can absolutely put dashboards together but when you have a question lets just get to the question,0.9989,0.107,0.023,0.87
med,won,company product,sales engineer alright so what im gonna do now is sort of switch gears and say when you have a quick you know what happens when you want to start so if you have to connect to third party vendor and get to the table and you know ive done something again keep in mind i think about what are we going to have in in this environment it just one table because the the way it was described as youd like to have feature ready datasets right in in client  so in that situation how am i going to go through it i pay to connect i say add a connection so let me just stop go back again for a second data architecture sales engineer all this way you know as i was going to and had all of these options in here that we didnt focus on that we focus on the end user experience im clicking on data if you go from data you of course you all the different objects tables columns and all of that and you click on embrace embraces that capability to connect to data rightremoved   removedthe rulessales engineer data management  functions sales engineer data management  functions sales engineer and and show you how to get the new data sets select the tables and columns that are interesting to you and then go from there so you can add a connection and im gonna call this as a signal i just dont have a new set science im just gonna use that data architecture sales engineer and im gonna say hey let me its a third party vendor environment you know if you have additional ones but here its really third party vendor because it will keep one again from third party vendor perspective we could be using a lot to to connect or you could use a service account im gonna use a service account here data architecture ends sales engineer but what ideas if you want users to have their own log ins and third party vendor and that can drive it that way you could always do that right so im gonna go in here im gonna use the company account im gonna just quickly put my credentials andand in this case im gonna use the cmo down balance right and so so this way ive now got ive said he was my connection parameters to the third party vendor environment and so im not off the second step to right is hey based upon this what tables you need from an atf analysis right so in our case i forget the table name rather than i can correct me on on that name i couldnt scribbling down quick enough yesterday when youre talking about the the name of the table but the ideas that i have this you know i can go to all the different environments in this case im going to go into the retail about environment and then data i have three tables im gonna use so ive got a fact table and a couple of we mentioned that again and dangling from the more complex data data modeling aspects of it because youre gonna have they said the posts that you will have taken that clientis to use featured any data sets but hed be support really complex scheme as behind the scenes right you could have multiple fact tables chasm traps you know fan traps things like that where depending on where youre like youre coming down you get some information need to aggregate the aggregate things like that we support lotsremoved   removedof complex scheme us but here im going to select the fact sales table right i could select individually columns that i want or because youre going to have another level of potential obstruction above this you can just select all the columns right so this way if someone has say hey i know that the information was in that table you could just get to that whenever you what you wanted an company ill also do the same thing for the retail stores the dimension tables for stores data architecture client good question yeah with regards to the architecture yeah so once we get the data out of third party vendor right is the data stored when we do the visualizationsales engineer great question the actually dont store the data but then company right the data is all based in third party vendor beach what all we have is the method data off your cables and third party vendor and when you when you query that is that only that is outside is coming in staying and invested in in memory for the duration of your okay visual representation the data set was not being stored in company you want to leave it down and third party vendor right imagine how much i forget what the number was was it removed in this particular table right,0.9967,0.098,0.014,0.888
med,won,pricing,client  that are quite many of those numbers yeahsales engineer right i think i yesterday i sent a note out late at night or late in the evening about that  columns maybe  goes you really dont want to replicate all of that in store that in in a bi tool right pricing ends sales engineer its gonna it doesnt make sense data we used to have in memory engine right but that thats not what i was trying to do and whatnot a lot of customers want to do that thats why we actually dont try to bring it in anymore data management  functions sales engineerremoved ,-0.2502,0.0,0.03,0.97
med,won,company product,  removed but so thats the big picture question but i was going to show that to you right right now hey epic these three tables im gonna say im gonna create this connection and so now these two tables that are available for me so what youre doing right now is its gonna creating that connection is reading third party vendors environment its removed get all the tape the columns the data types and all of that excuse me and if you have primary key foreign key relationships its going to leverage that as well i understand you dont do that in in in talker right now because that again youre going with a single table where youve got all the different features in in your environments right but do you notice how it says hey by the way some joins how did we get that those are defined on primary keys and foreign keys in third party vendor so we pick that up and let me just add this so i can apply this to a demo so i can easily get to that search types sales engineer but right to read that as soon as theyre done this i can actually go and start searching so if you imagine what you might be doing in in the plc right is lets say it was just the facts and save it right i just brought that up and i could just start searching right away and youll notice im getting suggestions but theres no usage based ranking but thats a core stop issue right data drill down sales engineer ive got the data it says hey this is how it is maybe you wanna look at sales right so i type in sales and what else could i be doing right so keep that in the field doing removed in sales maybe i wanna look at this by the region right then and yeah lets data management  functions account executivesales engineer do a weekly basis when i did something like this you didnt see me build anything else right i just drop those tables in the definitions of the tables in an company said this these definitions based upon what youve got heres what the queries are i mean that because i would related based on the primary key foreign key and i that i gave you the results this is immediately available to you so your instance unlocking the part of your third party vendor environment by just saying here that he was when he was,0.9772,0.078,0.019,0.903
med,won,about company,removed   removedclient just a question i tried it that im curious about the size of the data that were using right now with the fact you know sales tablesales engineer i think this is yeah its its a pretty small team no thats the other piece right so in your case youre gonna have to do removed data architecture sales engineer maybe its something im gonna rely on the underlying data so third party vendor read the what he had tried to bring together is the power of third party vendor and ease of use and search and export capabilities of third party vendor yeahclient so i wanted to do that yeah so i wanted to know what is the processing speed ecommerce team will take lets say for our  be in regards to be queried out in touch but so first of all we have to depend on the third party vendor where does that will be using but then wed be using the graduate or medium there does that does again the cost effective we have to be more cost effective that but we again have to have the visualization shop pretty quickly i speak type on the search so i wanted to know how company is able to to analyze that kind have queries if the data is latchsales engineer the data large when youre going live against third party vendor you underlying them appropriately stays third party vendor environment now keep this other thing in mind though i run something like third party vendor has a lot of different catching capabilities behind the scenes so you know they got the news caching that weather does that said catching so just because so the first but id on it i get it resolved and youll youll come in third party vendor will see that its the same query its gonna get you the disaster okay so it doesnt read on everythingclient no yeah under third party vendor part it already has been some in memory capabilities but the how much time we company does like if the quality is big enough company also have to take some the needle with one search thing that we are using right when that also take some more time to query on top of what such a third party vendor is query that how how is that gonna be performed,0.9961,0.17,0.023,0.807
med,won,company product,sales engineerremoved   removed so lets say the third party vendor but it takes  seconds around you know now you add to that the time it takes for that is all set to go into company and already quick rendering time on top of that that shouldnt be   seconds maybe  seconds company product ends sales engineer so too and i know that its its very quick my branding perspective but youre absolutely right that large tables or youre gonna rely on a on a appropriate besides does third party vendor environment and if i remember j mentioning this might have been just did i dont remember who mentioned that i think they use a ti excel third party vendor environment for for this particular use case so im going to accept a lot of ballclient hello we are not that he shot with the windows that wed be using but maybe thats not can shed some more light on it yeahsales engineer data architecture sales engineer and you know those would be things wed be going through as well right as youre going through an agency hey what is the average end of the day that is theres a user experience and theres the the infrastructure to support the user experience right and so when when people have said theyre going to use third party vendor as our database upload into the house and the performance engine will be writing the ferrari and be adding to that data management  functions sales engineer okay so now let me just pause here right so what i did was i just i brought in i brought in these two tables and you saw you know i was searching right away but typically you may do a few additional things beyond background so you may come back and say hey by the way this table name has you know things like this right data management  functions ends sales engineerremoved   removed its got sales id you know i dont want to go that sales id you know decided quantity but at  deck or data i want to call us transaction date something like that and you can either rename it or you know sales results according revenue i can give it synonyms things like that that and of course you got you got an f and you also saying hey what attributes of measures and so on it and by default you got obligations but you could add additional ones above that now its not going to be relevant in this particular use case because youre not going to join across data sets data management  functions sales engineer but if you did have to and they will know primary key foreign key relationships you could always said hey let me add a join and it just tells me you know what able too i wonder what does the dog a table that i want to join to select the columns and then the cutting out a few minutes if i wanted to join to retail stores just wanted to say store id is it a many to one one too many one type of relationship you can define those joins within company as well so so what ive covered as step one connect to the data warehouse data management  functions ends sales engineer you have to pick the tables davis and columns and then i started talking about defining business standard synonyms that sort of that step three making a business friendly the last step that you would go to is called setting designing the user experience and that is what we call is creating a worksheet and so the worksheet can include one or more tables right so in this case im just use the demo with so the ticket was ive got yeah and so from the from this notice as soon as i renamed and it automatically and headed that i want to lets say the sales first price lets see data drill down sales engineer and from the store maybe i want to store region store name city state and zip code and from the product table maybe i want the product name and the category i could also dynamic yield i could have said this is what i wanted to be i want to call this product and then additional things that as you said it i cant remember who i how should i might have asked a question about you know adding formulas data drill down ends sales engineer so if you wanted to add formulas things that you know that people are gonna last for theres a whole list of aggregation function you know even using the level of competition group after that say hey its calculated one level i want to roll it up at aremoved   removeddifferent level we go back to get calculations things like that you can add formulas right there right and you can then save it and im gonna call this as a six monthsales engineer theyre not microsite but anyway so and so ive now created worksheet right data management  functions sales engineer so rather than searching the tables what i could just go and say hey let me go search and instead of picking the three tables that i had i just hit ignore the tables i dont want those tables i want to use the music my worksheet and this way end users see only the things that are exposed to demo data drill down sales engineer so even if you have  columns if you dont want to expose them you only shows and so now i can go in and say show me the revenue by region right mid mid vested doing well what you know what category of products are doing well,0.9949,0.077,0.031,0.892
med,won,demo,sales engineer so rather than searching the tables what i could just go and say hey let me go search and instead of picking the three tables that i had i just hit ignore the tables i dont want those tables i want to use the music my worksheet and this way end users see only the things that are exposed to demo data drill down sales engineer so even if you have  columns if you dont want to expose them you only shows and so now i can go in and say show me the revenue by region right mid mid vested doing well what you know what category of products are doing well data drill down ends sales engineer all of that just gotten used to work together so thats a very quick and dirty sort of build from nothing to search expedients does that make senseclient yeah i have a question you type in revenue there so you see they have seen a name call it revenue so what if the user does not save any sending embed and basically types that revenue in particular regionsales engineer so lets try that way i can actually i type in revenue as just sending them so thats why it remembers that let me just go back and you know what actually this is another example of that so i dont know what revenue is but im gonna call it to see in a month or something like that right because lets just imagine that im done typing in that data that goes hey by the way i dont see that day right but i may see something thats like depending on what other data im allowed to see hey theres something like that so notice how its finding certain things which may be that and so we got a spell checker we understand data values that and theres individual columns so i also have a vaccines adverse effects data set in here and it says hey this kind of information maybe data to use as you get prompted for thatremoved   removedbut if you expect people to so this is part of you know designing the the worksheet aspect of it is really designed around the end user experience remember the getting started on not pull in terms of the use of this whole solution is the end users okay they need to be able to go anywhere that zip code that they use lets get them right tend to be always ask people thats the one but i think if you invest in trying to think about what are the different names i think about that is the same thing can be called in so many different ways you add that by the way they dont have to be done on day one you could think that made someone comes and says you know that nicole this is something s is revenue so you can come back and add the synonyms later on doesnt have to be done on day onesales engineer what other questions can i answer i know i was kinda covered a lot of things in a finnish okay and so this is just sort of getting getting is go ahead and things goingcompany employee sales engineer can you go babysitting two documents and we came across that it can be a script can be integrated with companysales engineer we used to support our but you know we have we have weve been trying to take a deeper look on into that is to say how can be generalized that in in doing more more than just our right because theres a option to dichotomy but at least it is theres a group of people who love i theres a group of people who left by it on the others would like tenser flow and things like that and you know so many different platforms and in the platform like data robot and others so so what weve be used to support our and you know that capability exists behind the scenes on our saas solution we havent exposed to our users mainly because we are you thinking that whole strategy and how to do that data transfer sales engineer hello because i can tend to get theres a single threaded as well right and you played with our you know one of the things that are not as you know its gonna try and bring all the data back end right just wanted to get more detail our model either detail data and you want to push it down to the data source right data architecture sales engineer how do you do that more effectively that kind of pushed on analytics is really important for remember the user experience again thats focused so today what aremoved   removedlot of our customers are doing is saying hey if i know that im going to run this let me run that model directly against the data in third party vendor data architecture ends sales engineer and thats another score for them right and youre gonna use actors out there and surface it have you heard about our being a core capability that thecompany employee no actually we are looking at the documentation that we found some interesting was the reasons too so we were thinking if we can integrated that email up and boots using that scriptsales engineer yeah we used to do that a lot because there are certain visual representations that are allowed you to bring to again again its our could have been used either for a lot of data scientists stuff or just appeal as a visual representation i know that existed not and just use that as a way to do it whats the if they can put back end our approach is anything that you see in company can also be exposed out to our api today and so that that api let me let me go into the screen so we have a whole develop api that i just click here and you you should have access to that as well and i think but the whole idea is there anything within you know you can do a visual embed or a full rest api implementation so we could do user using the rest api you could pass the data to any of your visualization you know your own custom visual representation and use that to vendor and they use that an embedded back into company or just you know to say hey actually just wanted to use you know the company pieces of office right so this this gives you the guided on that but if you want to play around and see how that would work right so lets say i go i click on say i want to search whatclient let me stop you there we have not table to see his screensales engineer my hi sorry about that let me let me go back to the start again so what did i do i clicked on the developer tab and what good trying to do here is allow it make it very easy for you to embed company any bad so you can choose to embed just a search or a visual representation or have been more of the full application so how would that work so if you just click on search for example and it says hey by the way this is again just to show you how the developer what can you can pick you know dig the lines of code and embed that can be a javascript application and so on if you wanted to do that and so you can pick a data source im just gonna im just gonna use the default one in here and you say hey by the way this is what the application looks like on the right if i wanted to collapse the data banner right justremoved   removedkeep it collapsed here and ive done it youll notice how the data abandonment collapse and its collapse and all you need is this line by the constant via search heres the javascript component that you need to make a copy into your application and well do that all for that matter you know i wanna say hide the data banner completely so now you wont even see that data right so these are different examples that you you would see now now the whole data and thats completely one that i can still go ahead and so its right i can do a lot of these that i was doing before and you can do that or you could say look i dont want to do that pinboard sales engineer actually wanted to dig especially especially pin board and just on that so which ones do we want to do maybe its hey joy this dashboard but its just better right i mean on that pinboard ends sales engineer so its not nothing pretty sure it was just one one single chart that i then and that is the dashboard i havent which is the details so you can take the whole dashboard and embed that i could have taken a different one and done it as well right pinboard sales engineer or i could have said rather than just doing the pin board i want to a specific visual representation so i can say from the different pin boards may maybe avenues lets see retail sales dashboard that has many different visual visualizations on it i want to just take a particular chart and dig that right and it says when i do that notice how the the code changes its its picking the pin board definition its putting all the ids in there gives you a very quick way to just take that will block and copy and paste into your application area and embed that pinboard ends sales engineer so when i run that its gonna just give me that visualization and put that into a job so idea behind that is to say we can do these type of things so if youll have want to build your own custom application within one visual representations you can use the company an embeddedclientremoved   removed yeah just on belt i had  got gonecompany employeeclient yet so i wanted to ask is there any other way we can embed custom visualizations into company and make it interactive if that is an option for using thatsales engineer right now that i mean that you know i can ask for them to to bring that capability expose it but you know that would be sort of going back right because i dont want to give you a capability that the plan to deprecate right now we have youd have youd have to do use a rest api use the data set does that come out of it and push that out or theres actually theres another option which i didnt think about which is again when youre doing search i theres theres an action to removed custom actions right so the custom action capability can see here heres what i want you to do with it i want to dig the custom action and so the custom action could be when you know when i run that right itll show up over here on on the three dots right so lets just say sales region and youll see an option you know for example here was a search same survey so this send survey could have been a news article to show that and then youre basically using company to pass the data to your our controls and then youre gonna allow our but itll still be in the embedded motionclient okay so from when we are coming that is we have someone custom visualizations that we want the end users or the c level people to look at so we were thinking if theres any other options other than the touch with see no bruises always was mentioning that we need to see some more they wanted some icons visualization so we were thinking if you could embed some visualizations using or something so i know this is pushing the data from dashboard to add and creating our own website but maybe our own solution for it but we want to bring in i dont customization to itsales engineer  yeah lets talk about that as we get furtherclient advanced visualization meaning we dont want to explore completely not is right its supposed to be trying to explore the our features which is related to company but you know advanced visualization meaning how much we can explore you know using then nps features and things like that from the data set that we have some logic is representations and things like that would be goodremoved   removedbecause we already have  you know  visualizations from this data as i tried to we wanted something different and you know logically and then but next steps sales engineer yeah lets talk about as we are getting further along i unfortunately have to jump i have a  oclock that i need to get to would it make sense for you to sort of go through some of those questions that that you have in mind thats but that

med,won,demo,csm good grief so slow alright let me share nowcsmall right so this this document talks about security but i wanna just get it just gives us some context for how i think about security and the ways that you want to control it so we have this concept the system privileges which is what people can do in the system right to the upload download so forth and then we have content security so can they see a particular worksheet a particular live board or whatever and then we have row and column level security so for the a lot of these were gonna recommend that you would use non shareable boards and so what not shareable groups to our user a normal user not an admin user belongs to a group and even though they belong to the group with someone else that cant share content without the person right and the reason these groups are important is because you can use it for privileges you can say all this is a data user right so they can manage data thats one of the privileges they have thats going to spam people who have access to different groups and content but cant share right and so you wanna make sure that use the non shareable groups you would also use this for role level security groups typically you want to when i have that separate out or does as well and so thats just a simple little you know dropdown option that you change when youre creating a group and so these are the privileges im like i go into those for this call because i dont think thats the topic you want to talk about but the key is that you know for sending that privileges i really do recommend that unless everybodys gonna have the same set of privileges you create a bunch of non travel or not a bunch be create a few non several groups that will have the privileges set and dont use us for other stuff differently content security use cases csm typically youre gonna want to do this by groups and so you mentioned a couple of different categories i think you said client something else so i would have assuming that the people who can see that are to the application level did i would have a group that is client right use cases ends csm and then they get to share that i would also make this non shareable because that means that once you share out lets say a live board to a particular group thats allowed to see that application content is still prevents them between organizations these different client organizations from sharing with one another and so that makes it easy to manage and say okay everybody gets access to this worksheet data access this live board and itll just show up right when they go and log in as long asremoved   removedthey belong to that particular group for the data security thats where were going to start getting into either a group level or individual user level depending on the level of granularity so if its just that people see data at the row level for im just for like a tenant and youve got a multi tenanted you know so basically a stripe data mart then you would use you know groups is typically what people will go with alternatively you can go down to the individual user level data management  functions csm but what that means is a new data you need to somehow have a mapping table that says you typically its from a fax level or dimension level to the individual user id of what they can see and you know if thats something that you think you require we can talk a little bit more about what that structure looks like data management  functions ends csm if he he is groups its usually better to do it to do it as groups but it depends a lot on your data and how that data is you know tags so you can figure out who should say in who shouldnt see it and then column of yepclient dont mind sure so when we talk about either less with the at the user level granularity and suppose we have a user entitlement managed at third party vendor side how do you want to how how seamlessly company support single sign on with third party vendorcsm so weve got a couple of different ways that we do this and so theres couple of different ways that people do role security you can do set up the connection to use pass through security which means that will require individual users to authenticate to third party vendor when you do that it means that thoughclient so we we need to go a single sign on we we dont want user to log into company and again log into top third party vendor when theyre trying to connect to databases not that is not the end user experience we are looking for it has to be a single sign on once you log into company thats pretty much itcsm so there is a new feature with third party vendor im not sure if its an eight one csm i dont know if you know the answer to this where we do now have singleremoved   removedsign on with third party vendor but wed have to look a little more at what that looks like you know im talking about csmcsm  sorry what was the question againcsm yeah so so they want to single sign on with third party vendor so it shows a key is that you want users to be authenticated against third party vendor individually correct not as hello yeah correct yeahclientcsm and i know we announced it was in that internal thing some sort of have a single site data management  functions client because i was talking about aligned and be one then the one hes planning to have their data segregated by user and they were because see dynamically changing service account for you one database connection based on the client is is factor level possible right so that means we need to say for example if they have   clients or  times we need to wireless printers service accounts right data management  functions ends client managing  service account is not a big deal we can have a sequel script doing that from third party vendor side but then we also need to manage internet connections in company correct each one for client yes data management  functions csmclient provided if you give us a guarantee that dynamically based on some really awesome way to define we can switch this over this account from one to anotherremoved   removedmaybe we get to have one connection defined in company and keeps between the  sick on far whoever is using it right data management  functions ends client that is something which is possible in company based on my knowledge so far i dont i dont think that as possible right not no its notcsmclient its not possible yeah that means that means you have to manage  connections  service account so that means you have duplicating the content connection at least and if there is any update to a connection rather managed that across the internet connections tonight correctcsmclient so that it becomes too much of a rather than management or what have thats why what the what i was thinking is okay we will how rollover security with the end of the user level in the database and then you provide as a single sign on between company installed make sure that we dont have to manage so many connections and so many service account so they use it goes in leaving third party vendor indicted the beta for that use it and that user will always see whatever it is put in put him or her installed so that is something which we are talking about okay so now to do that we need to have a support for the seamless single sign on between company and third party vendor with a single yeah,0.9996,0.156,0.008,0.837

med,won,pricing, pricing client so in or on we will be onboarding i dont say remove dot clients and that could be i dont removed users for example four two five users per client in case if we consider that way right and that means if for example now depending on the roles if we start creating at least two books for client right pricing ends ,0.296,0.035,0.0,0.965
med,won,demo,client that means we are talking about removed signed it oops in in company rightremoved   removedcsm what are those in a group for client that you see you you might not need the money sorryclientcsm that so so the the different types of groups that youre gonna need for the for the security of content across the applicant pricing client for example somebody who can create somebody who can only view right so at least those are two books which we thought there were three each client rightcsm  so thats what im trying to yeahclient pleased to at least two groups we will need the remove so that means we are we will end up feeling i dont do remove plus groups and removed users and it would be or a remove clients i mean if we consider remove as number of clients so it would be even more based on what we discussed with these business units i think it would be it would be more so nowcsm  if you have customer and customer be pinboard clientcsm you said two groups for each but what are those two groups for each costclientremoved   removed yeah one these customer okay create the pin boards and stories and so on and then what the the that would be just to read only who cannot create what who can talk to confirm zoom or read into that data and so on nothing beyond that pinboard ends csm so i dont know yet that you necessarily need to per client you might be able to get away just to for all clients if youre talking to just villages that the reason i have a client groups would beclient for our for our clients what do you mean by that because we have to arrange the content optimize the users and everything so how do we support multi tendency with the pool books for our clients if if that is the case we haveyeah something for thatyeah butcan i share my screen quicklyclientclientclientclientclient yes okay so alright so this is how it it is organized right now give me sick line  customers and you know internal external all of that they this is what hi good morning screenclientclientclientremoved   removed okay can you see it now yep yeah so lets say this is our company instance state to we have two lines of businesses right now one is the one one is client okay now these are the if i as customers to us who is supporting company right what being dont do is like they will have financial institutions okay hundreds or thousands of them okay not each client and lets see customer okay customer base client account executive now the one might be supporting like one  lie he has their own set of customers that they will on board and they will be like that okay okay what drive this talking about is not each of these customer lets say this is a remove customer base ends client right now they will have their own data set citizens will have their own data so okay no citizens obviously cannot see remove data and you know what content they have created what we have deployed for them and things like that so when we say multitenancy means to eleventh one or the other line of business level plus one level for the that is at each client level okay okay now i want to give you some context of how its done in third party vendor third party vendor and they log in and it gives me a site okay thats think of it like a sub domain on company they when they log into when i big dps all i can see is just lets see the one in this case none of the data sources that are configured for client or over a little bit like an arch it any content from the one do client thing is the then this one domain okay in this case what third party vendor does is like a fixed and optimize you see how it is clear its not its not in in our case it could be like d one audit could be client not under lowly be further it could be bank or from there you go or it could be citizens so here either we need a way to segregate all of company dui like like if i go into the company like everything in this context should be under the one our client like anything i got here tree needing to create anything i shared this cannot go from the one to client managing it with groups will make it a nightmare because youll have different lines of businesses and then different clients of each of them and what they can shared between each other you know too many security loopholes with that does that give a clear picture of what were trying to get deployment options csm it does it does yeah so so we do have some some sites like work coming but its not there right now right now the only real option is with the groups or i think in your ticket yet separate clusters i think separate clusters is going to be a management nightmare but but i just think would be a separate it would be a nightmare for thatremoved   removedclient yeah you could be like it could be here as wellyep butcsmclient deployment options ends csm so if we look at can you go back to your other slide there that powerpoint yup so so for this one and the way i would do it with current could company capabilities is i would have a d group and i would have a client group right and use those for content now those wouldnt be shared groups so this would be what we call non shareable groups which is kind of a bad name for it but what it means is that users that belong to do one did not get to automatically share with other users that belong to do one right and they wont the only way to share from do you want the client is if you remember but groups so if theyre already a member of one or the other they cant shareclient but but that will prevent them from sharing content within you want their group theycsm thats yeah so thats the first set thats just the domain right so if you think of client and do you want us domains thats the content level restriction there next would be for each of the clients so each group that you want to isolate users within that can share amongst themselves you do need a group for that and thats a shareable group so probably the client be away users would have a group right and it might just be be away now if you also had a be a way deep one group do you have that as wellthat does not mean that you know content created under this should be shareable under client it will just be under be onecsm right so the challenge there is that a b or a member of a group can createclient i think i think well party sorry to sorry to put you thereremoved   removed yeahclientclient deployment options client so two quick a shark right because we can go and well on and on with talking about it with them but the short but i want to understanding at this point of time with the with the company application architecture itself that that we will need to create so many groups to manage the content and permissions and sort of multi tendency that deployment options ends client so how much alert we then do is number of whoops the more we reduce number of whoops more risk of data breach content beak or anything so we dont want to get into that hasnt me too lawsuits and anything of that sort right youre all in the financial data business right we have to be very careful about natural we we cannot were shocked data management  functions client so this is another complexity here right so that could be one database with role level security one table for example that is built for all of the the one glance right and some could be built specifically for remove good now did would you be connections from here data management  functions ends client do this which will need to use like single sign on and then there will be some specific that only remove can access to this could be done with like a service account because all of the remove you know customer could access that but there could be common across these guys customer base csmremoved   removed yeah is theclient thecsm rl database centers that stripe like theres a removed id or somethingclient yes yeah so in that case this guy will need the past some

med,won,onboarding,client so this was to discuss each and every open items we had but then she is really was on the call we talked we complete that part first and see if we can address anything thats yeahcsm yes sir this is csm my plan was to attack the blockers first which is the multi tendency and the the other issue we talked about yesterday i think you know just worked on our listdon i mean they they the only other dimension of security that i that ive been thinking about onboarding process ends client i didnt i didnt bring it up because i i just but let me do that since you asked i think youve covered i think youve covered the critical requirements regarding the need to segment the data at the client level which you know were facilitating through third party vendor with role level security this may not be an immediate use case for d or client but i think its important to consider it because it will certainly become a future use case if we start using company for some other applications and im thinking rush and moving about the way weve got things working with the we we have use cases where for search for some client applications we actually enable different data sets and we allow our our customers to subscribe to those data sets so the idea is that you know you could be remove andremoved   removedover time incrementally you can subscribe to and get access to a client data set and then digital banking dataset and you know fraud use cases client and you know we have we have all these different business segments where certain customers have access to a multitude of of data sets and and we want to be able to give them bi tool access to that but we want to do it for mentally and and and sell it at a cost use cases ends client so to that end the idea is that you know any given user for that kind of an application may or may not be able to see all of the available data sets that that are available for that client in in third party vendor and so we would then want to further restrict access either through policies or groups or whatever so that for any given user thats logged in they can only access whatever subset of data theyve been provisioned for and so its sort of one additional dimension there right its a single application running you know potentially with a single instance of company and we to restrict access to the data both at the client level and then also i would say at the product level if you will or the you know the the data set level so and i bring it up only because you know my my assumption was that if we you know groups or additive like you and maybe you can just confirm that like if if i have a user i should be able to to assign a user to multiple groups and one group might define what client that theyre associated with but within that there might be sub groups or additional groups lets say here are the data sets that i can access for that client correct okay yeah yeahcsm that depending on on its hard and talking to ask the experts on it you know it might be possible that they belong to a client and then you know separately they belong to each of those data areas particularly if its row level security control at the client level then you know thats already going to filter the data down and then access to the content again it comes back to how strict you wanna make sure it is because if i have access to some data set and i worked for remove it is possible for me to share some stuff over to other customers so you might end up wanting to go with the the relevant security route for that as welldon well thats a good point too and thats thats actually a separate use case but a a an important one a client may have purchased access to a data set but there may be certain employees of that client that dont have any business you know being able to access it because of professional role so yeah rightremoved   removedclient no i dont think we are already being there in utah so it goes right to use a company then this will definitely a use case to be desired and then to do that we cannot have multiple instances right because if if each instance most one dataset thank the one like the fraud or whatever every  days or whatever then we will not we will do a cross send those things right,0.993,0.096,0.034,0.87
med,won,deployment options,client for the same type of customers it has to be a single instance the way we are managing it for instance rightdon well yeah and free with us the other wrinkle is and im not saying we have to do it this way but just for reference for whatever reason theyve actually created separate third party vendor databases for each of the different product datasets deployment options ends client so you know client isnt a separate database from from versus whatever and you know you can log in to third party vendor and be able to to access any of those databases essentially that that youve been provisioned forcsmclient right yep yeah thats that is a theater user can log in with their third party vendor right access and then they can they have access fordon okay alright well thats all i had i just wanted to throw that out there and but sounds like were in sync on the on those requirementscsm yup okay so circling back to the multi tendency question if i asked him do you have everything you need what are the next steps to just tie that conversation onclientremoved   removed we we know what we want and we are still confused as to what we needed to proceed to set up a business status right so i think our our immediate next step is to set up their revenue again you would have to these businesses so that they can start down up in their content and explore what is possible possible and then what would the limitations and try to work on those right,0.9844,0.134,0.01,0.856
med,won,next steps,client with some options right and then meanwhile we need to again brainstorm these options and the finalize the final enterprise architecture by that time and start setting up single node or a single instance onboarding students or whatever it is right so i think we need to buy some time to decide on that verified and production that yeah,0.296,0.037,0.0,0.963
med,won,deployment options,clientclient meanwhile i think its a good idea to release nonprofit setups to these businesses so that they can make the thirtieth then an extra things there and start developing fun alerting and so on and so forthdon yeah i agree with that alright alright so youre suggesting that we we set up two instances or just a single instance initially that they share deployment options client yeah i think we need to meet internallyyeah thats thats whatyou know sure sure on theclientclientclientremoved   removed thats right thats right because at the moment is capturing different instances we still need to run those aws resources right for each of them company licensing costs may not be there for multiple instances but city the resource costs maintenance costs everything there for that deployment options ends client i agree and i i think i think we should have that discussion because if if we can get by in the short term with a single instance might not do thatclient right yeah thats thats what were going to see what let us know how internal brainstorming and do some concise decision as to what would be our next step onboarding process client we know we know the product limitation at this point of time and we know what can be done and what cannot be done so probably yeah internally we need to meet up then finalize some approachcsm okay and i csm brought up the this new you know functionality is coming up later this year do you want more details on that we can pull in a product manager to discuss that or i think,0.9659,0.112,0.01,0.878
med,won,next steps,client not already mentioned about the liberty of sites later this year yeahcsmclient but then until we see that feature and on day to see what the limitations and the what are frozen parts were not we were to decide anything at this point right even if you just say theyre probably just like third party vendor you will that sites soclientremoved   removed can we can we change that like a feature request and and sort of work closely with the product development managers to just to ensure that it eventually when it is did meet our requirement yeah lets plan yeahclientclient we can certainly do that to do a deep dive and understand what theyre offering and then what is what are the gaps and are they willing to fill those gaps in case if it is possible we could definitely do that because that is there any way that order for them to bring in ancsm okay so ill well reach out to a product manager and get back to you guys on a conversation about thatclient yeah theyll be if you could can would that be good to a feature request and yup yup providers the deed or what what what tracking and permission you huhcsm okay okay alright perfect i do want to circle back to our conversation yesterday but i wanna make sure is there any other conversation on multi tendency either from the company side or the finance side next steps client i think after our internal brainstorming session where i think we might have some more questions to in terms of any use cases or is it not covered here would probably come back at the point of time you know in a in a weeks time bye bye say middle of next week okay alright,0.994,0.18,0.015,0.806
med,won,company product,clientclientremoved   removed if if i could ask real quickly though and i not not to deep dive on it but and i dont even know if you would refer to this as multitenancy but with the database aside if given given the capability the the company allows users to create custom content pinboard client and i in an example of that would be something like a pin board that i might create i think were going to want to absolutely allow users to not only do that but then to potentially share it with other users but only other users in their client organization pinboard ends client so it has everything that weve discussed before in terms of like you know associating user groups with clients would that also gives you the ability to restrict the content in terms of being able to share it and collaborate with other users in the same client orcsm  well i think thats a thats a good questioncsm so the the ability to share is based on the group that you belong to so they belong to say a remove organization and that was a shareable group and they could share any content within that with other be away users so it really comes down to careful group designclient okay so it sounds like a yes i just wanted to make sure that it wasnt like some other console because in third party vendor we were doing it slightly differently i believe using their sites capability butcsm yeah thats where the site so it will basically take a lot of this it gets a little tricky it takes good design with groups and itll give a separate more strict organization right so a user can be part of multiple sites with day cant share across sites they can only share within a site so if they want to work within a different domain right so the client to do one then they would have to change contacts within the application so not new log in there same user they just cant can span across the two so its a little more strictremoved   removed but i thinkclientclient the i think the answer your question i think there is always that is here that when when we create a shareable group then say for example you and i could have a lot of any of that business unit fit our our clients now new client you create the already shared it will group and citizens or it could they will share i think i will correct me if im wrong so i think we can share content which will do any particular as well because those two i share it oops can you restrict the lake and only share within view away i mean what is there to do thatcsm so im sorry the question was how do you restrict to be away can only share with them be away or how do youclient yeah yeah if if we i have a shareable group for view it as well as for another client client and plan we so how can we restrict sharing across from the client not to client we will also hascsm so the its only within the shareable groups to which that user belongs to unless theyre an admin user so if youre itd bl la and they have several groups you only share it to those that you belong to there you dont share to other groups that have shareable boards so shareable group means that a user who belongs to that group can share with other users in that same group yeah yeahclientclient which i think satisfies the requirement i mean as long as if i logged in as a be have a user and im not a member of client group you know by definition in terms of how its configured then i should be able to share with other be have a users but i wouldnt be able to share with with client and thats exactly what we want,0.9988,0.19,0.028,0.782
