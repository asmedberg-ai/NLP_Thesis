med,lost,deployment options, data architecture nameclient to ship to ship this point though have you done any benchmarking to compare performance in memory versus directly pulling data out ofsales engineer we have them we do when you know whenever we bring on a new technology as a new connector and we do have a strong partnership with database that we worked our into engineering teams to develop that and to make sure that you know when you go through the connection screening thoughts by you choose which cloud data warehouse which data source youre choosing and when you choose thatremoved  removedspecific one it is engineered to change the way we actually write the sequel queries behind the search behind the question youre asking so it is optimized based on the delta like implementation of sequel to your point you know in that performance testing in memory will be faster its i mean you just cant beat in memory thats kinda the whole point of the memory but its not orders of magnitude faster i mean were still talking to a matter of seconds response time from from delta lake and when youre asking those questions and there are different configurations in tuning that we can do on both sides as youre continuing to load more data and as were getting up to the removed of garden said to make sure that those queries are still behaving in a fast response data architecture ends client right so i tap that point i think one of the things then we would be looking at or proof of concept you know for the same effort is to choose you know dataset that actually you know isnt the billions of records so that you know as you said when we move we would go to production with this,0.8308,0.04,0,0.96,postive,1

med,lost,pricing,client right so i tap that point i think one of the things then we would be looking at or proof of concept you know for the same effort is to choose you know dataset that actually you know isnt the billions of records so that you know as you said when we move we would go to production with this pricing client we dont want to get surprised you know while it works great for a number records but not so not so good for removed so this would be something wed want to prove out with the psc as wellaccount executive under percent and grow,-0.4274,0.047,0.063,0.89,negative,0
med,lost,onboarding, onboarding process account executive and as we get closer to building out what the plc looks like and scoping it together we can certainly identify what are those top criteria that this needs to we need to prove out to make sure this is a success when were talking about scale with company,0.8934,0.213,0,0.787,postive,1
med,lost,company product, use cases account executive that would be fantastic grand i know weve discussed for the sake of the proof of concept and inventory management use case that was top of mind and timely is that still the case and if so can we you share a little bit more about thatclient in inventory in terms of its availability in the in the day like is is not there thats something that we have in process data management  functions client something were working on there are a number of tables that we need to bring in put it into our process layer and ultimately build a model and are prepared layer so at that point then we could circle back into the process layer and make it available for data like for the purpose of the po si data transfer client however we can we can do something that were doing in the interim which is to take from whatever sql servers databases which as snapshots of our inventory which basically has the kind of the pretty much the final set of data that were going to any way build only one from our native assets sql tables so basically simulating what would we have at the end of the day after we do all of our data engineering so and we do we need to do that anyway in order to pull the data in for historical snapshot so so that would be that would be our approach there use cases client but makes it easy there is that basically its one one big table that has everything already altogether so for the purpose of a plc we spend less time data modeling and more time getting and user feedback we also have some requirements from the team where theyre very interested in being able to take inventory data and combining it with forecast or demand or inventory you know comparing a supply forecast the demand forecasts data management  functions clientremoved  removed so these are all the other data sets that were building up but step one is getting access to core inventory data and that would again that would be our approach is to leverage what weve already built out pull that in and be able too you know show how it can be much easier to analyze the data that the business is used to using it instead of having to go and grab the data export it create more dashboards and so forth data management  functions ends client of course were were looking at a very much from an end user point of view i wanna make sure however that from an install point of view firms getting is up and running in terms of being able to get the approvals to do that were all on the same page so that way you know as long lead time so that once we get the business interest of this we dont want to put them on pause for six months you know its important that we are you know able to move quickly once once we all are on the same page data transfer sales engineer and is that the process today client you said they have to download data to an excel file and do some kind of shaping a modeling themselves and then upload that back to build a dashboard on top of itclient sure because what we have right now and our sql database is not something that they actually query and build the build anything and they have to move it to another place data transfer ends client you know its just basically a you know a  year old not even the day like its just a bunch of tables that are out there that they can query against and move them someplace else so its not very user friendly so what happens is and its happening all over the company people in the data thats a good place together data management  functions client they grab it they build their own little mini mini data towers and they go to work and then we have this proliferation of data models and no central us already or control so the idea here is now that we are building a video we do this from the etl and we have the flexibility to give users and easy way to kind of do what theyreremoved  removeddoing right now without having to do a lot of data modeling so thats what we want to prove out our plc dont go through that use a tool like this and quickly be able to to to do what you need to dosales engineer got it okay and that that one big table i mean can you defined big for me just logging scaryclienti dont have a row row count on this but i can get back to you on thatsales engineeri mean do do you know how wide it is as wellclientits pretty its pretty big i mean youre talking about youll be talking about all of the all of the inventory across you know the entire world i mean we have tens of thousands of skews we have you know many suppliers we have you know many manufacturing facilities you know distribution centers its a camp very complex network sosales engineer okay and so this is the table then that moving from the process so the prepared layer is kind of d normalized into a relational structure with the with the keys and relationships between them data transfer client well i mean this table this table is already done because this is are all kinds of sql environment its already been kind have theres already a process in place that when the month and take that take all that data create a snapshot of it and save it off into another place thats what were talking about here data management  functions client wed be kind of replicating that and and client by taking the native tables pretty much not adding a lot to that but just creating a a method going forward thats more sustainable and also being able to combine it with other data sets so but were not there yet to to be able to use that final end model for inventory but we can leverage what weve already builtremoved  removed okaysales engineersales engineer use cases  and i imagine given the size and scope of that table does contain all the different data elements that would be a part of any question and then use or would haveclient  operational inventory analysis yes okaysales engineername i have one question regarding the performance metrics what we talked about right data architecture name so since the compute and the data store is going to be data breaks the performance metrics is mobility clue what name has set right so what im trying to understand is is there any specific performance metrics company has to offer here because the computer is going to be on client the data is already organized on totally prepared as the platform is coming from the performance most of this off most of the tools or the bi tools right they have a computer engineering and the performance indicator is based on that but when you say that company has a performance indicate when you mentioned that youre compared with other tools i feel that theres more related to client with this the data store as of now versus the company software itself is my understanding right search types sales engineer youre talking about pure compute and processing time yes oftentimes when were talking about performance and speed as well were talking about speed for an end user to get the answer to their question as well so its and also i mean just to what client was just talking about about trying to reduce the proliferation of data across the enterprise and trying to kinda reduce those data silos that exhibit or that build up over timeremoved,0.9983,0.082,0.011,0.907,postive,1
med,lost,company product, data architecture sales engineer i mean when youre having to do data extracts and put things in cash and different bi layers to enable performance on those its its a bit of an extension of that so were were very specifically designed it because we knew our customers were wanting to stop that and they did not want to have another caching there because frankly thats what the in memory database was for all intents and purposes in south,-0.3447,0,0.044,0.956,negative,0
med,won,company product,sales engineer alright so what im gonna do now is sort of switch gears and say when you have a quick you know what happens when you want to start so if you have to connect to third party vendor and get to the table and you know ive done something again keep in mind i think about what are we going to have in in this environment it just one table because the the way it was described as youd like to have feature ready datasets right in in client  so in that situation how am i going to go through it i pay to connect i say add a connection so let me just stop go back again for a second data architecture sales engineer all this way you know as i was going to and had all of these options in here that we didnt focus on that we focus on the end user experience im clicking on data if you go from data you of course you all the different objects tables columns and all of that and you click on embrace embraces that capability to connect to data rightremoved   removedthe rulessales engineer data management  functions sales engineer data management  functions sales engineer and and show you how to get the new data sets select the tables and columns that are interesting to you and then go from there so you can add a connection and im gonna call this as a signal i just dont have a new set science im just gonna use that data architecture sales engineer and im gonna say hey let me its a third party vendor environment you know if you have additional ones but here its really third party vendor because it will keep one again from third party vendor perspective we could be using a lot to to connect or you could use a service account im gonna use a service account here data architecture ends sales engineer but what ideas if you want users to have their own log ins and third party vendor and that can drive it that way you could always do that right so im gonna go in here im gonna use the company account im gonna just quickly put my credentials andand in this case im gonna use the cmo down balance right and so so this way ive now got ive said he was my connection parameters to the third party vendor environment and so im not off the second step to right is hey based upon this what tables you need from an atf analysis right so in our case i forget the table name rather than i can correct me on on that name i couldnt scribbling down quick enough yesterday when youre talking about the the name of the table but the ideas that i have this you know i can go to all the different environments in this case im going to go into the retail about environment and then data i have three tables im gonna use so ive got a fact table and a couple of we mentioned that again and dangling from the more complex data data modeling aspects of it because youre gonna have they said the posts that you will have taken that clientis to use featured any data sets but hed be support really complex scheme as behind the scenes right you could have multiple fact tables chasm traps you know fan traps things like that where depending on where youre like youre coming down you get some information need to aggregate the aggregate things like that we support lotsremoved   removedof complex scheme us but here im going to select the fact sales table right i could select individually columns that i want or because youre going to have another level of potential obstruction above this you can just select all the columns right so this way if someone has say hey i know that the information was in that table you could just get to that whenever you what you wanted an company ill also do the same thing for the retail stores the dimension tables for stores data architecture client good question yeah with regards to the architecture yeah so once we get the data out of third party vendor right is the data stored when we do the visualizationsales engineer great question the actually dont store the data but then company right the data is all based in third party vendor beach what all we have is the method data off your cables and third party vendor and when you when you query that is that only that is outside is coming in staying and invested in in memory for the duration of your okay visual representation the data set was not being stored in company you want to leave it down and third party vendor right imagine how much i forget what the number was was it removed in this particular table right,0.9967,0.098,0.014,0.888,postive,1

high,lost,about company,solutions engineer  yeah yeah its a great question so i mean the funny thing is would ultimately need to go from from third party vendor to company is i was reminded of earlier my career when i was working with removed and this is around the time that third party vendor came to start to be kind of a dominant player in the marketplace industry issues  solutions engineer removed    removed  and you know at the time removed had visual insight right which in the course of a  minute demo wed spend maybe three minutes on that digital insight piece saying hey yeah we check that box as well see its pretty cool now lets get back to the real task at hand of determining what your enterprise canned reports canned dashboards et cetera needs are  about company  solutions engineer  and so theres theres kind of a lot of by the symmetry between that time in the market in in in where were at today which is you know power bi has at what is q and a or answers third party vendor has asked data and i go back to the idea that account executive i i dont know how many customers we actually have,0.986,0.175,0,0.825,postive,1

low,lost,company product,company employee  so ill take a i use third party vendor as an example for this one when youre creating the extract and third party vendor they recommend a single fact table with a couple of other you know dimensional tables connected and then that extract is committed to memory so its very simple data model and anytime that you need to model multiple fact tables into an extract things become extremely client  if i call company employee  you have to write custom sequel to do it you have to do a couple of workarounds and unfortunatly it just brings the third party vendor server down to a crawl itcan really slow down the performance company was just naturally built for many too many joins across multiple fact tables  search types  company employee  so what that really means is sales and markmarketing data sets can be put together sales and inventory can be put together and people can ask more complex questions using an easy interface like search and the data just generate the answer in a couple of seconds its something thats truly unique  search types ends  company employee  so once an analyst or a data engineer realizes how much easier it is to model data and a worksheet and then just give that that more complete data set user much higher success rates are starting to happen because of that alone some of the other things that weve added in recently we call one feature search assist this is the idea of when we onboard a brand new user they receive an email and it takes them through its three step process of the ai familiarizing itself or personalization so what data sets have you been granted access to see who are other users in your social group  pinboard  company employee  maybe like your analyst or other peers that you want to follow its kind of like a social engineering aspect and then what metrics do you care about more than others and not all the other metrics will get dropped out its just that it will bring these more important metrics to the top  search types  company employee  so that free personalized homepage experience which is already an enormous benefit after that searches this is a feature for analyst inside a worksheet that they can create the starting questions that will teach an end user without having to go through a classroom setting every time so its an automated process that says welcome to company heres your new homepage experience data drill down  company employee  these are the data sets you have access to heres the most popular reports and dashboards and then if you want to start try search its gonna take you through stepbystep process of okay what we see you have access to this sales data set you can ask questions like sales by region monthly and it will actually ask them to type those words out and then itll you know create a trend line for them showing that regions trending over time and so anyway you can add as many questions as you want and that acts as a personalized training for each dataset,0.9947,0.123,0.01,0.867,postive,1

slice by number so i was saying so yeah again theres theres a way in the syntax to say top five partners by partner call partner item cost instead of top days we had the we had the wording a little wrong and so it render the wrong thing but theres a way to limit the customers down to a smaller set but yeah i think you get the idea of of kind of how you play with it and yeahaccount executivesales engineer hello client as as another one lets say like one of these spikes are valleys you wanted to drill in data drill down sales engineer im not sure what you want to drill into but all you gotta do is hover over it right click and hit drill down and youll get a list of all those attributes data drill down ends sales engineer so if you wanted to go into state city zip or what have you you could do that or any of them carrier or you can type in there and itll bring it up there you go partner name and if you dont right and you can also actually if you go into the far left access there you see where it has been a little carrot click on that okayclientsales engineer yup and you could sort this the sending or whatever annual annual you know you just just another way to look at the data right so now youve got likethe top everything right and you can even fit the number to the to the screen as well versus the scroll bar name sales engineer like you see there and down at the bottom theres a scroll bar because of number data pointsclientlong tail probably is not as useful right drops off significantly down herewhat elsethat i want to so we didsales engineeraccount executivesales engineerthe other thing is maybe you dont want a pretty picture you see where youve got a little button up here thats got the blue yeah click on the table view or click on that button data drill down sales engineer and this is sticky so if you just want to operate in a tabular view you can do that as well okayclientsales engineer the auto visualization is the other way and if you just click it again itll go back so you can you can toggle that switch back and forth got it okay i just toggleclientsales engineer yep and then just above the gear but you see the same visualization button if you click on that you can choose what type of visualization you want okayclientsales engineer but lets go back so this is kind of some look and feel and we can set up some office hours to do more data management  functions sales engineer but lets go back to the data tab because i do want to show you some other stuff in there as well before we let like pure end users go at this so youve got your prep orders the retail apparel demo is this something that it ships with i put a tag on it this morning so that we could differentiate between what you guys are doing and what ships your tag data management  functions ends clientsales engineer yeah thats my and so what we wanna do is go up to the ellipsis over in the far right around button there click on that and lets say lets create a worksheet and if you go to the left and create and click on sources i guess at the end up and then grab your table yeah prep orders close that and now if you open it on yep right there lets just say out of all of this there was only  or  records that you really wanted to give certain users you can not records but columns you can select them that you wanna use by double clicking them or highlighting as many and then clicking add columnsclient  or control and click the there you gosales engineer yep and yeah right because some of these probably you dont you dont i dont i dont know right but certainly lets also definitely pick a city state zip and countryclient leave it up for i end up selecting everything sales engineer now you can hit add columns there at the very bottom right below product you just lost itsorry thats all right yousee just belowclientsales engineerclientyup mitigate a few or they select that i can always come back and add to our rightsales engineer yeah but definitely do the geo ones because i want to show you something specific about thosegocity state zip countryclientsales engineerand product right right below product to see add columns right there youclienti miss crap quantity as well alright add columnssales engineersir outstanding now lets hit save button give it a namesales engineerperfect the other thing that you can do in a worksheet that i didnt mentioned i should have below the sources there was a formulas if i wanted to add formulas to this worksheet its just a spot that everybody that has access to this worksheet will now have that kind of global formulaclient doingsales engineer a one off in a report or an answer but in here you see right or the aggregate are the aggregations correct and then the next one is synonyms so partner name order number product quantity i can add in that synonyms column a comma the limited list of what people use and there every day verbiage to describe these things got it so yeah like search types clientsales engineersales engineer like the one i usually show is you know is it is it is it a fraud product skew item right you can just eliminate list and then the net and this is important for those non technical end users that you know what language do they use data drill down sales engineer and that just makes the search experience way more pleasant then for that auto visualization if you go over to the geo for state zip or country city obviously is is an endpoint to a drill in from a zip or something but for what where are we on i think it was state state whats that data drill down ends clientsales engineer click on sub nation or so yep sub nation announced stateclientsales engineeryep and then zip code and thenclient no we have lots of dirty data in here sosales engineerso defaults doubles its default as a measure when it comes inthats fineand then country yeahokaysave thatnamesales engineeraccount executivesales engineerclientand turn off phases measures since its the order numbersales engineeryeah yeah yeah you cannot change that to an attribute first and then d select additive and the aggregation its gonna tell you you need to change as well you dont have to go exactly in that order butgot it i safeclientsales engineersave and now if you go back to search right choose sources youll see in the top the upper part where it says worksheets theres your tests view and justclient yousales engineerselect the prep bordersturn this off okay data drill down clientsales engineerclientsales engineeryep and then hit close now your normal end users only ever going to see worksheets right okay and probably only one or two because were admins we see the entire entirety of it so now yeah you can open that up and if you say a quantity by country or something or quantity and countrysales engineer actually double double click it or type it right into the search bar i look at already you know and youre youre gone quiet and then country and hit enter i probably should have checked your we do that thats pretty coolclientsales engineer right and now just as a task lets drill down into the united states and go to stateright rightsales engineerhi click yeah i think we might have just gone tosales engineeralright so it looks like youve got state does that stateclientclientsales engineer looks like and then you know if you drill down to that you could even go to zipssales engineer and you only have one so if you switch over to tabular view its funny because i was literally just doing this the other day the same the same thing where it was only a couple of zips in the state that were in are there it is quantity three if you wanted to you could actually drill on this and go into like order number or item or product or or do we have vendorclient yeah so i guess my bigger question is like why did we only see state when we drill down from united statessales engineerlets kill this if you go to the x on the search barkilled all thingclientsales engineeryep and throw united states in there and our state through thrown state in there just type in state enter data drill down ends sales engineer lets see what we get here well thats why it says well you know why did we only see me a favor and say actually go down to state in the actual column here nope over over in the answer side yeahclientsales engineer and hit that ellipsis and just filter that i want to see something and actually you know what im gonna do im gonna just request control aswell yepi see what youre sayingokaysales engineerclientaccount executiveclientwhats the issue all possible values that show everything for the samplesales engineerread my mind right when i was sitting here slightly pharma and then i was like here we go this is probably why why its notwowthats pretty crappyyeahsales engineerclientclientsales engineerhes in here right my guess would be that its something to do withlets see this real quickso hes the auto searchsales engineersales engineersales engineeryeah itll be interesting to see how how it works with because im sure like you got em i state and there was mir up here multiple times so im not chit could very well beclientsales engineer it may it might have just totally confuse the map to a certain degree so it might have been a i would want to confirm what were looking at from a country perspective on quantity enter on this and lets you it its definitely pretty youre looking at it at the map though isnt it data drill down client  it is makes for a great demosales engineer absolutely there there may need to be a little bit of work on that and i can look at that behind the scenes as well not to get bogged down in this completely like totally take a look at this because i have access as im sure you know as an admin to this to this as wellsales engineersales engineerbut for quantity thats all you have seems does that seem odd based on theclientyeah i mean youre not filtering data anywhere so that seems really oddsales engineeryeah id have to check the data because it looks like right i just said show the underlying data when theres only two records for united states country data drill down ends sales engineer data drill down  yeahsales engineersales engineer right so you could actually we wanted to take this and see what the returns and third party vendor but this is exactly where its coming from so theres only theres only three records and then if i drill down to state here statesales engineerclient hi is this hitting third party vendor every time we see those sort of three bubbling dots yes and nothings getting cash anywhere its not like were catching up with data along the way data architecture sales engineer were indexing these values and whatnot but were not moving the data over and theyre not caching as far as i know name mayname right no other queries should be run in real time against the data thats in your third party vendor so you can paste those you can you know paste those queries directly out of our interface intoaccount executive  third party vendor and run them yourself there data architecture ends sales engineersales engineer is there maybe another metric that you guys use quantity stageclient quantity is the only thing i have another view right now i mean thats thats just part of that we look at revenue and profitabilitysales engineer yeah because its just theres i mean according to this theres theres only data for united states for state with quantity for those time periods we look at any quantity and what is it delivered day and production date is there a day that mightclient would they were you using just a new quarter create date thats the data to you working man june  clientsales engineersales engineer yeah something ill definitely have to look into because like you just like we just saw right when i true in that order create date theres plenty of data and data yepclientsales engineer and theres all the zip codes you can see its definitely its some its the one the one nice thing about this is without having to write sequel you can see the bad data right right and start interacting with it right so when i drilled into state why am i getting this up here and and this so i have a sneaking suspicion that its just the quality of the data we can obviously still work with it but it could be it could be sketchy from time to time here did not like apparently state except for the mapping data management  functions client you dont need to bog down in the mapping that we only have a few more minutes whats the i want to join a table you could just walk me through thatsales engineer yeah absolutely so if you had the joins done theres the top three in state if you had the joins done using the primary keys foreign keys in third party vendor and you selected those tables they would automatically come in as joined okayclientsales engineer if you want to join them in in company you see this joined button right here say i had multiple tables that we had brought in already i can just add those joins right here heres my source table select your other table whatever it might be and then select the column that it that it actually joints to you right obviously this table is not related to an all but you get the ideayepclientsales engineerand if its more of a compound join you can add columns here as wellclientokay and that just becomes part of this d normalized viewsales engineerit would just be joined on that to this d normalized view data management  functions ends sales engineerand then to to your point what you would do like this test view i would have to edit this and add that new calm i mean add that new okayclientsales engineer right so if i if i come out here and i add this table lets say itll itll add it but because theyre not joined its going to be great outclient got it okaysales engineer and heres the formulas as well you can come in here you can just start typing theres assistance as well whats kind of neat though is lets say i wanted to do a quick one as i start typing maybe ill say i want to do quantity see how it just starts popping in there like a leads leads leads leads the way so i can do quantity times i dont know product whatever it is and you have all sorts of different aggregate type calculations you can do count if some if sounds you have all your standard kind of if then else all that fun stuffclient heres a question just real quick on a formula to one is is there an assumed level of granularity that its calculating the formula on is it calculated at the role levelsales engineer yeah i believe so yes right so like it was interesting because yesterday i was dealing with a customer and they had used they had used this this aggregate aggregate i think they use the group aggregate for something and all that was was they wanted to take out they had fees and they wanted to sum that up slightly differently and literally all they had to do is say some if they didnt i have to do an aggregate if if you want to calculate add an aggregated level then you have to create that aggregate level right so its something from the transaction level on up across all of your all of your own attributes so if you need to do something more advanced and i need to calculate some so states or the zips are the cities whatever that granularity is in regional automatically go off the country right i want to calculate something differently at the country level then you need to use that aggregate kinds of functionalityclient okay so the second question on the formula is is that only relevant to this data source now that were its only relevant the studiosales engineerclientsales engineer this worksheet yes okayyes theresclientsales engineer thats correct and this worksheet is just a logical layer sitting on top of that prep borders table from third party vendor and its only attached to this worksheet or this test view as we call themclient okay so if i created you know client company good and gross profit as opposed to maybe our partners gross profit would i id have to do that in every worksheet that i created where were where were gonna use calculate profitsales engineerclientno way to really centralize our govern use of calculations across worksheetsales engineertheres not a concept of a global metric that you can just plop and pick wherever you want to worksheet right now use cases sales engineer its only at the worksheet level i believe thats on the road map but right now its only into worksheet levelclient okay well thats helpful i mean a lot of what we do centers around this view at least as it relates to managing our our backlog our productivity our supply chain but those metrics will apply and other places as well use cases ends sales engineer  sure yeah absolutely they always dok yeah okay i dont i went on our our time i whats the recommended way to really start digging in here and replicate some of the stuff that weve weve builtsales engineer yeah absolutely i mean essentially right you saw how easy it is to get connected assuming that we have our our account name correct yup,0.9999,0.132,0.028,0.84,postive,1
low,won,next steps,clientsales engineer and start using this now yeah youve got basically  days that you can essentially do whatever you want you can contact me via email we can set up a weekly or or you know a couple of times biweekly office hours are meetings but if you have any questions just shoot me an email and we can take it from there normally weve got at least one or two meetings a week when im when im doing these so that we can connect and either one of us i usually dont but if you if you have an issue or you dont need to me obviously you can just send me a note cancel it and that time yeah next steps ends ,-0.2617,0.044,0.045,0.911,negative,0
